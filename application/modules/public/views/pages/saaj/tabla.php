                            [Hindi tabl&#257;, from Arabic t&#803;abla, from Aramaic t&#803;abl, drum, perhaps of
                            Persian
                            origin; akin to Middle Persian tumbag,</p>

                                align="left"/><span>Tabla is a pair of drums.  It consists of of a small right hand drum called dayan and a larger metal one called bayan.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>The tabla has an interesting construction. The dayan (right hand drum) is almost always made
                            of wood.
                            The diameter at the membrane may run from just under five inches to over six inches. The
                            bayan (left
                            hand drum) may be made of iron, aluminium, copper, steel, or clay; yet brass with a nickel
                            or chrome
                            plate is the most common material. Undoubtedly the most striking characteristic of the tabla
                            is the
                            large black spot on each of the playing surfaces. These black spots are a mixture of gum,
                            soot, and
                            iron filings. Their function is to create the bell-like timbre that is characteristic of the
                            instrument.</p>
                        <p>Although the origin of tabla is somewhat obscure, it is generally belived that it evolved
                            from the
                            barrel shaped drum called pakhawaj. This was about three hundred years ago.</p>
                        <p>The tabla is the most popular percussion instrument used in the classical and popular music
                            of the
                            northern regions of South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, northern India, Pakistan).
                            The
                            history of this instrument is at times the subject of heated debate. Reliable historical
                            evidence
                            places the invention of this instrument in the 18th century. Another common historical
                            narrative
                            portrays the tabla as being thousands of years old, yet this is mere conjecture, based on
                            slipshod
                            interpretations of iconography. The term tabla is an Arabic word which means &quot;drum&quot;,
                            and
                            this attests to its status as a product resulting from the fusion of musical elements from
                            indigenous Hindu and Central Asian Muslim cultures that began in the late 16th century. </p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold">Nomenclature and construction</p>
                        <p>The smaller drum, played with the dominant hand, is called d&#257;y&#257;&ntilde; (lit.
                            &quot;right&quot;;
                            a.k.a. d&#257;hina, siddha, chatt&#363;) and can also be referred to individually as &quot;tabla.&quot;
                            It is made from a conical piece of wood hollowed out to approximately half of its total
                            depth. One
                            of the primary tones on the drum is tuned to a specific note, and thus contributes to and
                            complements the melody. The tuning range is limited although different d&#257;y&#257;&ntilde;-s
                            are
                            produced in different sizes, each with a different range. For a given d&#257;y&#257;&ntilde;,
                            to
                            achieve harmony with the soloist, it will usually be necessary to tune to either the tonic,
                            dominant
                            or subdominant of the soloist's key.</p>
                        <p>The larger drum, played with the other hand, is called b&#257;y&#257;&ntilde; (lit. &quot;left&quot;;
                            aka. dagga, dugg&#299;, dh&#257;m&#257;). It is a bowl shape made of metal (or sometimes
                            clay or
                            wood, although not favored for durability). It has a much deeper bass tone, much like its
                            distant
                            cousin, the kettle drum.</p>
                        <p>The playing technique for both drums involves extensive use of the fingers and palms in
                            various
                            configurations to create a wide variety of different sounds. On the b&#257;y&#257;&ntilde;
                            the heel
                            of the hand is also used to apply pressure, or in a sliding motion, so that the pitch is
                            changed
                            during the sound's decay. This &quot;modulating&quot; effect on the bass drum and the wide
                            range of
                            sounds possible on the instrument as a whole are the main characteristics that make tabla
                            unique
                            among percussion instruments.</p>
                        <p>Both drum shells are covered with a head (or puri) constructed from goat or cow skin. An
                            outer ring
                            of skin is overlaid on the main skin and serves to suppresses some of the natural overtones.
                            These
                            two skins are bound together with a complex woven braid that also gives the entire assembly
                            enough
                            strength to be tensioned onto the shell. The completed head construction is affixed to the
                            drum
                            shell with a single continuous piece of cow or camel hide strap laced between the braid of
                            the head
                            assembly and another ring (made from the same strap material) placed on the bottom of the
                            drum. The
                            strap is tensioned to achieve the desired pitch of the drum. Additionally, cylindrical wood
                            blocks
                            are inserted between the strap and the shell allowing the tension to be adjusted by their
                            vertical
                            positioning. Fine tuning is achieved by striking vertically on the braided portion of the
                            head using
                            a small hammer.</p>
                        <p>The skins of both drums also have an inner circle on the head referred to as the siy&#257;h&#299;
                            (lit. &quot;ink&quot;; a.k.a. sh&#257;&#299; or g&#257;b). This is constructed using
                            multiple layers
                            of a paste made from cooked rice mixed with a black powder of various origins. The precise
                            construction and shaping of this area (especially on the smaller drum) is responsible for
                            modification of the drum's natural overtones, resulting in the clarity of pitch and variety
                            of tonal
                            possibilities unique to this instrument. The skill required for the proper construction of
                            this area
                            is highly refined and is the main differentiating factor in the quality of a particular
                            instrument.</p>
                        <p>For stability while playing, each drum is positioned on a toroidal bundle called chutta,
                            consisting
                            of plant fiber or another malleable material wrapped in cloth.</p></td>
