                Bhagat Ravidas Ji was pious and
                religious
                minded right from the beginning
                and thus came in contact with many
                spiritual
                men and adopted Swami Ramanand
                Ji as his Guru. Bhagat Ravidas Ji
                made his
                living as a cobbler. He
                distributed
                a major part of his income among
                the poor and
                needly. Once Queen Jallibai
                presented him with costly clothes
                and
                ornaments as depicted above. He
                enlightened her by saying that the
                name of God
                was more precious than
                the ornaments. By
                the turn of the fourteenth
                century, the Muslim
                rule had been comfortably
                established in India. When Bhagat
                Ramanand
                (1366 - 1467 A.D.) came to
                Northern India and made
                Kashi/Benares as his
                home, he noted that the Muslim
                religion had penetrated: a
                considerable number
                of Hindus had 'been converted,
                and they had adopted Islam as
                their religion.
                Ramanand was an orthodox
                devotee of Shiva. He was, no
                doubt, impressed
                with the Islamic theory
                of Oneness of God and Feeling of
                Equality in
                social set up, except Ruling
                Feudal Elite, the Muslims of all
                classes
                mingled indistinctivety in every
                aspect of life - living, eating,
                religious
                ceremonies, marriages, etc.
                But he was very much distressed to
                observe
                that these criteria were enhancing
                the conversion of Hindus,
                particularly of
                low-caste, into Islam. He forsook
                the Shivaite austere practices
                endowed to him
                by his Guru, Ramanuj, and
                initiated the veneration of the
                Unjversal
                Brotherhood. He accepted Hindus
                of low-caste and Muslims to join
                him in
                worship, and become his followers.
                Among his most noted disciples
                were Kabir - a
                Muslim weaver, Sam - a barber,
                Dhanna - a cultivator, and
                Ravidas, a cobbler.
            </p>
            <p class="black">There is consensus
                that Bhagat Ravidas was
                born on Maghushudhi 14 Pooranmashi
                in Smt.
                1456, i.e. February 1399 in
                Kashi. His parents were in the
                leather trade,
                and were very well off.
                He was barely five days old when
                Bhagat
                Ramanand visited his house and
                blessed the child. When he reached
                the age of
                discretion, his father inspired
                him to join the family business.
                But Ravidas
                was imbued with with celestial
                and humane values. The money he
                received from
                his father for business,
                he spent in the welfare of the
                Saints and
                needy. His father was extremely
                perturbed and banished him from
                the house. By
                thAs time, Ravidas was already
                married. He did not resent,
                quietly left the
                house, started living in
                a make-shift hut with his wife,
                and set up a
                small wayside shop of menthng
                shoes.</p>
            <p class="black">He did not abandon
                his love for the God and
                built a Temple of clay walls and
                thatched
                roof. He installed an idol made
                out of hide in the Temple. His
                extreme
                devotion and universal love
                induced
                hundreds of people of all castes
                to join him
                in worship. This resulted
                in enviousness among the Brahmin
                priests who
                raised the matter in the
                Court of Muslim Nawab of Kashi.
                The Nawab was
                a man of righteousness,
                and put the matter to a miraculous
                test.
                Bhagat Ravidas went into
                meditation
                and recited one of his hymns
                (Gauri Purbi
                P.346) and requested the Almighty
                &quot;Take
                pity on me that my. doubts
                may be dispelled.&quot; His prayer
                was answered, and his adoration
                acclaimed the
                triumph in the miraculous
                test. To express his gratitude he
                sang his
                hymn (Asa P. 1606), &quot;Thou
                art sandal and I am the poor
                castor-plant,
                dwelling close to thee. From
                a mean tree I have become sublime
                and Thine
                fragrance, exquisite fragrance,
                now, abides in me.&quot;</p>
            <p class="black">A rich man tried to
                allure him with the charm
                of wealth. He gave the Bhagat a
                philosopher's
                stone by the touch of which
                one could change any article into
                gold. In
                spite of Bhagat's refusal the
                rich man left the stone hung under
                the
                ceiling. When he came back after
                one year, the stone was still
                hanging there.
                The rich man announced to
                the world the indisputable
                godliness of Bhagat
                Ravidas. This episode is
                considered to be an ecclesiastic
                test to judge
                Bhagat Ravida's endurance
                towards the worldly love. But some
                accounts
                associate this to the devious
                manipulation of the Brahmin
                priests to
                discredit Ravidas, which, rather,
                ended in the triumph of the
                Bhagat.</p>
            <p class="black">Ravidas's selfless
                devotion and casteless
                love for humanity spread far and
                wide.
                Maharani Jhally of Chitaur was
                a noble woman of benevolence and
                piety. Her
                ardency brought her to Benares
                on a pilgrimage. In spite of the
                disapproval
                of the Brahmin priests, she
                straight-away went to the Temple
                of Bhagat
                Ravidas. Ravidas was in h:s
                ecclesiastic benediction at the
                time, and was
                reciting his hymns (Rag
                Sorath P.658-59). Maharani was
                captivated.
                Eventually she became his disciple
                and abandoned all her luxurious
                set up. Her
                husband, the Maharana, had
                been instigated against her
                adopting a cobble
                as her Guru. He was full
                of rage when she returned. H~ was
                pacified by
                listening to some of the
                hymns of Bhagat Ravidas but still
                wanted to
                put the Bhagat through a test
                to invalidate the allegations of
                the Brahmins.
                The Bhagat was invited
                to Chitaur and and requested to
                participate in
                an oblation. The Brahmin
                priests refused to eat while a
                cobbler was
                seated in the same column of
                rows. Bhagat Ravidas voluntarily
                moved away.
                But, miraculously every person
                distributing food looked like
                Bhagat Ravidas
                to the Brahmins (Another
                account states when the Brahmins
                sat down to
                eat, they saw Ravidas seated
                between every two of them). They
                complained to
                Maharana. Maharana comprehended
                the hidden meaning of this marvel,
                and himself
                became an ardent devotee.
                Bhagat Ravidas remained in Chitaur
                for a long
                time. It is said that Mira
                Bai became his disciple as well
                during that
                period. As per some accounts
                he died at a ripe old age of
                nearly 120 years,
                in Benaras.<img

            <p class="black">There are 41 verses
                of Bhagat Ravidas in
                the Sikh holy book, Guru Granth
                Sahib. Most of
                them are in very clear
                Hindi. His poetry is brimming with
                ardent love
                for God, Universe, Nature,
                GurU, and the Name. His sarcasm
                and pique
                shows his closeness with God.</p>
