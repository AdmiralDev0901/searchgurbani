                Farid breathed his last in 1266AD
                &amp; a year after in 1267AD, was
                born
                in the state of Maharashtra
                another devotee of God by the name
                of Trilochan.
                The hymns he composed later in his
                life lead a person on the path of
                spirituality
                through varied precepts. Guru
                Arjan Dev ji included these hymns
                in Siri
                Guru Granth Sahib Ji, making them
                a part of Shabad-Guru.</p>
            <p class="black"> Trilochan was born in the village
                Barsi, near the town of Sholapur
                in
                the Maharashtra state, though some
                scholars hold the view that he was
                born in Uttar Pradesh &amp; that
                there was a Marathi influence on
                the
                language of his hymns in
                consequence of his prolonged stay
                in Maharashtra.
                Trilochan was a contemporary &amp;
                close friend of Bhagat Namdev
                (1270-1330).
                Bhagat Trilochan observed that
                whenevr he called on his friend
                Namdev,
                the latter always happened to be
                busy in one worldly affair or
                another.
                At last one day, Trilochan could
                not restrain himself and asked his
                friend
                that he always appeared occupied
                in worldly affairs, how did he
                find the
                time to remember the Lord? Namdev
                satisfied his friend's curiosity
                in
                a very convincing manner and told
                him that althoguh his hands were
                engaged
                in worldly occupation, his mind
                was ever fixed on Him. For a
                householder,
                this was the best way to
                remember/worship God. Trilochan
                felt rather satisfied
                &amp; happy at this answer. As
                says Bhai Gurdas, in his Var:
                X.21, it
                was Namdev who introduced
                Trilochan to his Guru who showed
                him the way
                to the Lord.</p>
            <p class="black"> Bhagat Trilochan Ji always gave
                more importance to Bhakti (love
                &amp;
                devotion) in preference to selfish
                interests. He said that he who is
                always
                occupied with problems relating to
                wealth and property will never
                become
                happy. He always served the saints
                at his residence with the utmost
                dedication
                and humanity. </p>

                exact place of birth is not known.
                Some historians claim its Barsi
                near
                Sholapur, Maharastra and others
                claim its Uttar Pradesh but spent
                most
                of his time in Maharastra. The
                fact that two slokas of Kabir
                constitute
                a dialogue between Nam Dev and
                Trilochan shows that these two
                saints were
                contemporaries.<br/>
                There are 4 shabads by Bhagat
                Tirlochan in the Siri Guru Granth
                Sahib.
                In these he has condemned
                superficial rituals and
                pretentious renunciation
                and stressed the holiness of the
                heart.</p>
