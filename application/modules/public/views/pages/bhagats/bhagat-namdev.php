                name was always on the lips of
                Bhagat Namdev Ji. He was asked by
                the king
                to show miracles. Bhagat Namdev Ji
                refused to do so and was thrown
                before
                a drunk elephant to be crushed to
                death. God saved His own saint.
                Bhagat
                Namdev Ji spent the last day of
                his life in village Guman, now in
                district
                Gurdaspur, Punjab (India). </p>
            <p class="black"> Guru Granth Sahib recognizes many
                saints of the Bhakti movement of
                medieval
                India. Namdev are the saints
                belonging to this movement which
                swept across
                the North India from 1100 A.D.
                till 1600 A.D. When Fifth Guru
                Guru Arjan
                dev ji compiled Guru Granth Sahib,
                he decided to give some
                recognition
                to the saints of Bhakti movement,
                that is the reason that Guru
                Granth
                Sahib contains verses of such
                saints. In some cases Guru Granth
                Sahib
                is the only voice remained for
                such saints over the years. </p>
            <p class="black"> According to the generally
                accepted version of the current
                traditions,
                Namdev was born in AD 1270 to
                Damasheti, a low-caste tailor, and
                his wife,
                Gonabai, in the village of
                Naras-Vamani, in Satara district
                of Maharashtra.
                Janabai, the family's maidservant
                and a bhakta and poetess in her
                own
                right, records the tradition that
                Namdev was born to Gonabai as a
                result
                of her worship of Vitthala in
                Pandharpur. Namdev was married
                before he
                was eleven years of age to
                Rajabal, daughter of Govinda sheti
                Sadavarte.
                He had four sons and one daughter,
                Under the influence of saint
                Jnanadeva,
                Namdev was converted to the path
                of bhakti. Vitthala of Pandharpur
                was
                now the object of his devotion and
                he spent much of his time in
                worship
                and kirtan, chanting mostly verses
                of his own composition.</p>
            <p class="black"> In the company
                of Jnanadeva and other saints, he
                roamed about the country and later
                came
                to the Punjab where he is said to
                have lived for more than twenty
                years
                at Ghuman, in Gurdaspur district,
                where a temple in the form of
                samadh
                still preserves his memory. This
                temple was constructed by Sardar
                Jassa
                Singh Ramgarhia and the tank by
                its side was got repaired by Rani
                Sada
                Kaur , mother-in-law of Maharaja
                Ranjit Singh . In his early
                fifties,
                Namdev settled down at Pandharpur
                where he gathered around himself a
                group
                of devotees. His abhangas or
                devotional lyrics became very
                popular, and
                people thronged to listen to his
                kirtan. Namdev's songs have been
                collected
                in Namdevachi Gatha which also
                includes the long autobiographical
                poem
                Tirathavah. His Hindi verse and
                his extended visit to the Punjab
                carried
                his fame far beyond the borders of
                Maharashtra. Sixty-one of his
                hymns
                in fact came to be included in
                Sikh Scripture, the Guru Granth
                Sahib.
                These hymns or sabdas share the
                common characteristic of lauding
                the One
                Supreme God distinct from his
                earlier verse which carries traces
                of idolatry
                and saguna bhakti. In the course
                of his spiritual quest, Namdev
                had, from
                being a worshipper of the Divine
                in the concrete form, become a
                devotee
                of the attributeless ( nirguna)
                Absolute. </p>
            <p class="black"> Bhagat Nam Dev is a pioneer of the
                Radical bhakti School. Though he
                appeared a century earlier than
                Kabir, his religious and social
                views
                are very much like those of Kabir.
                He unambiguously repudiates all
                the
                four fundamentals of Vaisnavism.
                Though in his devotional approach,
                he
                is clearly a monotheist, he makes
                many pantheistic statements too,
                e.g.,
                every thing is God; there is
                nothing but God; consider the
                world and God
                to be one; the foam and the water
                are not different. Chaturvedi
                writes:
                &quot;Sant Nam Dev seemed to
                believe both in transcendence and
                immanence,
                in pantheism and nondualism. His
                devotion was purely of the
                non-attributional
                absolute. He also considers God to
                be immanent, everywhere, in all
                hearts,
                and the Creator of everything.
                Like Kabir and the Sufis, Namdev
                is very
                other worldly. He says, &quot;The
                strength of contempt of the world
                should
                be in the body an unchanging
                companion. One should lay aside
                differences
                between oneself and others, and
                feel no anxiety for things of the
                world.&quot;Ranade
                also writes: &quot;He (Nam Dev)
                tells us that it is impossible
                that the
                pursuit of God can be coupled with
                a life of Samsara. If it had been
                possible
                for a man to find God while he was
                pursuing Samsara, then Sanaka and
                others
                would not have grown mad after
                God. If it had been possible for
                him to
                see God while carrying on the
                duties of a householder, the great
                Suka
                would not have gone to the forest
                to seek God. Had it been possible
                for
                people to find God in their homes,
                they would not have left them to
                fond
                out. Nam Dev has left all these
                things, and is approaching God in
                utter
                submission (Abhg. 83).<img

                        height="240"
                        align="right"/></p>
            <p class="black"> NamDev's cosmogenic views are also
                orthodox. He says that God created
                maya and &quot;maya is the name of
                the power that placeth man in the
                womb.&quot;Indirectly,
                he is neither happy with the
                world, nor with the human birth.
                Him, shop,
                shopkeeper, men and everything are
                unreal excepting God. In this
                background
                he seeks release from the world
                and suggests renunciation: &quot;
                Namdev
                gave up trade, and devoted himself
                exclusively to the worship of God.
            </p>
            <p class="black"> The world being a play of maya and
                not being a worthwhile of
                spiritual
                endeavours, Namdev's goal is to
                have union with God through
                devotion and
                singing. His praises. He says,
                &quot;I perform worship, sing
                God's praises
                and meditate on Him for eight
                pahar in a day i.e, round the
                clock. At
                the same time, he suggests good
                conduct and purity of life. For,
                God created
                all men alike. Though he holds
                every person responsible lor his
                acts,
                he clearly does not believe in a
                world rigidly governed by karma.
                13ecause
                he says: If everything were
                determined by karma, who created
                karma originally?
            </p>
            <p class="black"> NamDev not only claims union with
                God, but, like Kabir, also states
                that more than once God
                miraculously intervened on his
                behalf to reveal
                Himself to him, or help him.
                Without doubt, Nam Dev's approach
                remains
                otherworldly both before and after
                his achievement. At one time, he
                even
                gave up work so as to remain
                absorbed in his worship and
                meditations.
                He never initiated any religious
                institution or movement. His was a
                solitary
                search for God, without creating
                any social or religious
                organisation.
                <br/>
                We find that in his repudiation of
                Vaisnava doctrines, in his
                metaphysical
                ideas, methodology and goal, and
                more particularly in his
                otherworldly
                approach to the world and society,
                Namdev's views are quite identical
                with those of Kabir.</p>

                        The Lord drank the milk,
                        and the devotee returned
                        home.<br/>
                        Thus did Nam Dev come to
                        receive the Blessed Vision
                        of the Lord&#8217;s
                        Darshan. || 4 || 3 ||
