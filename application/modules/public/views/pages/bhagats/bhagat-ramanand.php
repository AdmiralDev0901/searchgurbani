            <p class="black"> Swami Ramanand Ji is
                considered a
                pioneer of the great Bhakti
                Movement
                in Northern India. He had also
                been regarded as the bridge
                between the
                Bhakti Movement of the South and
                North. Though a Brahmin by birth,
                he
                did not entertain any sense of
                pride because of his caste. The
                above scene
                depicts the Swami and Bhagat Pipa
                Ji who received divine
                enlightenment
                by the grace of Swami Ramanand
                Ji. </p>
            <p class="black"> Swami Ramanand is
                rightly regarded
                as an eminent of the bhagati
                movement
                in northern India and as a
                distinguished leader of the
                Bhairagi Movement.
                He was a follower of Swami
                Ragavacharya of the Ramanuj
                Movement (1017-1137).
                In the later part of his life the
                Archarya commanded more respect
                than
                even his own Guru and came to be
                known as an exponent of Rama
                Bhagati.
            </p>
            <p class="black"> Born in 1366,
                Ramanand was the son
                of Bhoor Karma and Sushila. He was
                mystically inclined from his early
                childhood. Acharya Ragavnand,
                showed
                him the path of Yog sadhna.
                Ramanand also visited places of
                pilgrimage
                such as Kanshi, where as mark of
                respect, people built a memorial
                that
                stands there to this day. After
                his pilgrimage, Ramanand realised
                that
                God can be worshipped by everyone
                whereas his Guru Archarya
                Ragavnand,
                who comes from the Sadhu Varna
                Ashrama believe that not everyone
                is entitled
                to perform Puja Bhagati.</p>
            <p class="black"> Hence he started
                preaching his
                gospel in Kanshi and imbued many
                devotees
                with the spirit of Bhagati. Kabir
                was the most renowned amongst his
                disciples.
                Ravi das, Sain, Dhanna and Pipa
                are believed to be his followers
                even
                though all of them were not his
                contemporaries.</p>
            <p class="black"> Ramanand was a
                learned Pandit.
                Many of his books such as Sri
                Vaishnava,
                Matanbuj Bhaskar, Sri Ramarachan
                Padhti are still available. One of
                his
                hymns has been inserted in the
                Siri Guru Granth Sahib under Rag
                Basant.</p>
            <p class="black"> Bhagat Ramanand was
                the Guru, or
                spiritual teacher, of Bhagat Kabir
                and a disciple of Raghavanada, a
                known preacher of the Ramanuja
                tradition
                started by Ramanuja, a Tamilian by
                birth &amp; the founder of the
                Rama
                bhagati or devotion to Lord Rama.
                Ramanand was born in AD1366 under
                a
                tree. The followers of Ramanand
                hold this tree in as much
                reverence as
                they do his real mother, Sushil by
                name. He spent all the 101 years
                of
                his life at his birth-place Kashi,
                (allahbad-Prayag, a holy city of
                Hindus,
                according to researchers) devoting
                every moment to the remembrance of
                Divine Name. He provided a new
                tone &amp; tenor to the Bhagati
                movement.
                He saw that the contemporary
                society was drifting towards a
                particular
                direction under the influence of
                Lord Krishna's life as it was
                enacted
                in every village and town.
                Therefore he made successful
                endeavours to
                divert this mass tendency of the
                people, towards Rama-worship.
                Ramanand
                was above caste consideration, and
                therefore he initiated to his
                idealogy,
                people even from the so-called low
                castes. He also started several
                new
                trends in Vaishnava bhagati, the
                most important of which is that
                everybody
                has the right to worship God. As a
                result of this altruistic gesture
                on
                his part, the stream of Rama-Name
                flowed even up to the cottages of
                the
                poorest of the poor and the
                lowliest of the low. Consequently,
                the spiritual
                life of those so-called low people
                got elevated. In the society,
                which
                was then bound in the shackles of
                the caste-system, such utterances
                had
                revolutionary effects. As it was,
                Brahmins were the only community
                which
                had the birth right to perform
                various rituals &amp; observances
                connected
                with religion. But the liberal
                attitude adopted on the part of
                Ramanand
                led the Vairagi (a renouncer)
                tradition to accept him as their
                prominent
                Acharya (Hindu religious teacher).
                In this way, a new sect among the
                Vairagis
                under the name of Ramadatt came
                into being. This sect stressed
                celibacy,
                physical prowess &amp; intense
                devotion to God. Gradually,
                Ramanand drifted
                from Vaishnavism to the worship of
                One Formless Lord.</p>
            <p class="black"> Ramanand had several
                disciples who
                guided mankind on the way to
                bhagati
                (worshipping). Bhagat Pipa was one
                of his prominent disciples. Pipa
                was
                a king who gave up his ego &amp;
                came under the patronage to seek
                spiritual
                guidance. As a king, he served his
                subject to their utmost welfare.
                Bhagat
                Ramanand also wandered about in
                Pipa's kingdom for some time. On
                the basis
                of his first-hand knowledge, he
                testified that was as a good a
                saint as
                he was a ruler. In his regime, all
                subjects enjoyed peace, justice
                and
                material comforts irrespective of
                caste or class.<img

            <p class="black"> Ramanand has only
                one hymn
                included in SGGS ji under Basant
                measure.
                Outside the Sikh Scripture, two
                more compositions of Ramanand are
                extant.
                These works are said to be of high
                literary value. These are: Sri

                Matanbuj Bhaskar &amp; Sri
                Ramacharan Padhati.</p>
