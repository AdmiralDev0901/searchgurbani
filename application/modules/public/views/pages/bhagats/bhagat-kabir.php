                Kabir Ji </h3>

            <hr/>

            <p class="subhead">&quot;From the One
                Light, the entire universe welled
                up. So who is good, and who is
                bad?&quot;</p>
            <p class="black">Bhagat Kabir Ji was a revolutionary
                saint-poet of the Bhakti Movement.
                He emphasized the equality and
                fraternity of
                all mankind. Once Bhagat Kabir Ji
                was going to sell cloth he had
                made himself. He met some Sadhus
                (a renunciate
                spiritual devotee) on the way whom
                he gave the entire cloth free of
                cost.<br>
                Saint Kabir Das (kabir, Arabic for
                &quot;great&quot;, dasa, Sanskrit
                for &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;servant&quot;),
                is widely acknowledged as one of
                the great personality of the
                Bhakti movement in North India. He
                was as is widely
                acknowledged born in Year 1398
                A.D.(71 years before Guru Nanak).
                Kabirpanthis (followers of Kabir)
                say that he lived
                upto the age of 120 years and give
                date of his death as 1518, but
                relying on the research of Hazari
                Prasad Trivedi,
                a British Scholar Charlotte
                Vaudenville is inclined to lend
                credence to these dates and has
                proven that 1448 is
                probably the correct date of Saint
                Kabir's demise.</p>

                     align="left"/>He is one of
                the medieval Indian saints of
                Bhakti and Sufi movement whose
                compositions figure in
                Sikh Scripture, the Guru Granth
                Sahib. From among all of them,
                Kabir's contribution is the
                largest, 227 Padas in 17
                ragas and 237 shlokas. Under each
                raga or musical mode marking a
                section of the Holy Book, Kabir's
                hymns appear at
                the head of Bhagat Bani, a generic
                name for the works of contributors
                other than the Gurus. The presence
                of a
                substantial amount of Kabir's
                verse in the Sikh Scripture and
                chronologically he being the
                predecessor of Guru
                Nanak, founder of the Sikh faith,
                led some Western scholars to
                describe him as the forerunner of
                Sikhism. Some have
                even called him the preceptor of
                Guru Nanak There is, however,
                ample evidence to prove that Guru
                Nanak and Kabir had
                ever met their periods of time in
                fact do not coincide. Kabir's
                compositions do figure in what are
                known as Goindval
                Pothis, anthologies of the hymns
                of the Gurus along with those of
                some of the Bhaktas prepared in
                the time of Guru
                AmarDas, Nanak III. They were
                inclucled in the Guru Granth Sahib
                as well But this happened much
                later when Guru
                Arjan, fifth in spiritual line
                from the Founder, compiled the
                Holy Book Besides his own works
                and those of his four
                predecessors, he entered in it
                hymns of some saints and mystics,
                both Hindu and Muslim, Kabir was
                one of them.</p>
            <p class="black">Kabir lived in the fifteenth
                Century after Christ, which was a
                time of great political upheaval
                in India. As is true
                of many contemporary religious
                teachers, very little reliable
                information concerning Kabir's
                life is available,
                though there is no dearth of
                legend gathering around him.
                Kabir's life was centred around
                Kashi, also called Banaras
                (Varanasi) Legend has it that he
                was actually the son of a Brahmin
                widow who abandoned him and that
                he was found by
                a Muslim weaver named Niru, who
                adopted the boy and taught him the
                weaver's trade. It is not clear
                whether he ever
                married, but tradition gives him a
                wife named Loi and two children.
                His caste was that of Julaha and
                from his
                sayings his caste's heriditary
                occupation of weaving. On the
                basis of modern research, it seems
                probable that Kabir
                belonged to a family of
                non-celibate yogis converted, not
                long before and to a considerable
                degree superficially to
                Islam. From the writings of Kabir
                it seems that his knowledge of
                Islam was slight, rather in his
                poetical utterances
                (Bani) a wealth of Hathayoga
                terminology and a thought
                structure which bears obvious
                resemblance to Nath Yogis. Nath
                Yogis in addition to the yogic
                conception that all truth is
                experimental, i.e. to be realized
                within the body with
                the aid of psycho-physical
                practices, concentration, control
                of breathing and thus making the
                body incorruptible and
                the yogis immortal.</p>
            <p class="black">Bhakti movement was started by
                hindu saints while Sufi mysticism
                by Muslim saints in medieval India
                (1200-1700).
                Kabir immensely contributed to the
                Bhakti Movement and is considered
                a pioneer of Bhakti along with
                Ravidas, Farid,
                and Namdev. His concept of love as
                a path of suffering may possibly
                indicate, in some measure, a debt
                to the Sufis.
                These and other elements from Nath
                tradition, bhakti and sufism,
                kabir combined with his own
                mystical nature and
                produced synthesis which is the
                distinctive religion of Kabir.
                Tradition tells us that Swami
                Ramanand was his Guru
                (a teacher).</p>
            <p class="black">In fifteenth century, Benaras was
                the seat of Brahmin orthodoxy and
                their learning center. Brahmins
                had strong hold
                on all the spheres of life in this
                city. Thus Kabir belonging to a
                low caste of Julaha had to go
                through immense
                tough time of preaching his
                idealogy. Kabir and his followers
                would gather at one place in the
                city and meditate.
                Brahmins ridiculed him for
                preaching to prostitutes and other
                low castes. Kabir satirically
                denounced Brahmins and
                thus won hearts of people around
                him. There is no doubt that single
                most famous important person from
                the city of
                Benaras today is none other than
                Saint Kabir.</p>
            <p class="black">Kabir through his couplets not only
                reformed the mindset of common
                villagers and low caste people but
                give them self
                confidence to question Brahmins.
                It was 100 years after him that
                Tulsidas broke the hegemony of
                Brahmins by writing
                Ram Charitra Manas, a poem of
                Ramayana at Benaras which went
                against the tradition of Brahmins.
                Kabir was in fact
                first person to go against
                Brahmins and be so successfull.
                Benaras was devasted by an attack
                by a Muslim invader
                Tamur Lang or &quot;Tamur the lame&quot;
                during his time. Kabir also
                denounced mullahs and their
                rituals of bowing
                towards kaba five times a day.
                Because of open condemnation of
                established and popular religoins,
                Kabir became an
                object of the wrath of both Hindus
                and Muslims in and around Benaras.
                Kabir travelled in and around
                Benaras to
                preach his beliefs.</p>
            <p class="black">Kabir believed in sell-surrender
                and God's bhakti. The Kabirpanthis
                follow a lite of singing the
                praises of God,
                prayers and a simple and pure life
                of devotion. Kabir recommends
                ceaseless singing of God's
                praises. He virtually
                suggests withdrawal from the
                world. He is against al1
                ritualistic and ascetic methods as
                means to salvation. It is
                true that Kabir refers to some
                yogic terms in describing the
                meditational and mystic methods of
                the yogis. But,
                there is no ground to suggest that
                he himself recommends the yogic
                path. In fact, far from
                recommending yoga, he is
                quite strong in condemning ascetic
                or yogic methods, and says that
                yogis, in their meditations,
                become prey to maya.
                The point will, however be
                considered further while comparing
                Radical bhakti with Nathism.</p>
            <p class="black">The moral tone is quite strong in
                Kabir's hymns. &quot;Kabir deck
                thyself with garments of love.
                Love them is given
                honour whose body and soul speak
                the truth.&quot; &quot;The ruby of
                goodness is greater than all thc
                mines of
                rubies, all the wealth of three
                worlds resides in the goodness of
                heart. When thc wealth of
                contentment is won, all
                other wealth is as dust.&quot;
                &quot;Where there is mercy, there
                is strength, where there is
                forgivenesss there is
                He.&quot; &quot;The man who is
                kind and practises righteousness,
                who remains passive in the aftairs
                of the world,
                who considers creatures of the
                world as his own self, he attains
                the immortal Being; the true God
                is ever with him.
                Kabir suggests inward worship and
                remembrance of God. For him, true
                worship is only inwards. Put on
                the rosary
                inward. By counting beads, the
                world will be full of light. He
                clearly suggests moral
                discrimination betwecn good
                and bad deeds. What can the
                helpless road do, when the
                traveller does not walk
                understandingly. &quot;What can
                one
                do, if, with lamp in hand, one
                falls in the well.&quot; &quot;Or
                goes astray with open eyes.
                Discern ye now between
                good and evil.&quot;</p>
            <p class="black">It is not surprising that Kabir's
                satire was brought to bear not
                simply on the vices and weaknesses
                of men but
                reached through and beyond them to
                the very system themselves. It was
                the authority of Vedas and Quran
                that more
                then the authority of Brahmin or
                Qazi which Kabir attacked. He
                rebelled against the pretension of
                resolving by the
                means of books or by way of
                authority, the mystery of human
                conditions and the problem of
                liberation (Moksha). He
                spent his last 40 days living in a
                place where it was believed that
                if you die you will born as a
                Donkey in next
                life.</p>
            <p class="black">Kabir is a firm advocate of ahimsa.
                His doctrine extends even to the
                nondestruction of flowers. &quot;
                The life of
                the living you strike dead and you
                say your slaughter makes it
                dedicated. It is blood haunting
                you and those who
                taught you.&quot; &quot;They fast
                all day, and at night they
                slaughter the cow; here murder,
                there devotion; how can
                this please God? O' Kazi, by whose
                order doth thou use thy knife.&quot;
                &quot;When you declare the
                sacrifice of an
                animal as your religion, what else
                is sin. If you regard yourself a
                saint, whom will you call a
                butcher ?&quot;
                &quot;The goat eats grass and is
                skinned, what will happen to those
                who eat (goat's) meat? &quot;Do
                not kill poor
                jiva, murder will not be forgiven
                even if you hear a million
                Puranas. Among the fifty
                commandments laid down for the
                followers of Kabir, vegetarianism
                is one of them. For Kabir, moral
                life involves adherence to
                ahimsa.</p>
            <p class="black">Kabir composed no systematic
                treatise, rather his work consists
                of many short didactic poems,
                often expressed in
                terse vigorous language in the
                form of Padas, Dohas, and Ramainis
                (forms of poetry in Indian
                languages). Besides his
                work recorded in 1604 A.D. in Guru
                Granth Sahib by Guru Arjan Dev,
                Nanak V, and preserved inviolate
                since, two other
                collections exist - Kabir
                Granthavali, and Bijak. In his
                poems, he was quick to tell the
                illustrations of moral and
                spiritual truth in the incidents
                of everyday life , and many of his
                similes and metaphors are very
                striking.</p>

                Kabir ji is ranked 5th as regards
                the volume of Bani contributed to
                SGGS ji, and from the 15 bhagats,
                he contributed
                the maximum number of hymns. His
                total contribution is 541 hymns
                set to 18 different musical
                measures (Ragas). Kabir
                has been accepted as the most
                revolutionary of all the saints of
                the Bhagati movement. He was the
                prominent disciple
                of Ramanand, and din't hesitate to
                strike blows at futile religious
                observances &amp; formalism.
                Ramanand once
                advised him to get up early in the
                morning &amp; remember the Lord.
                This advice impressed him so much
                that he
                propogated this throughout is
                life, awakening masses from their
                daily slumber of ignorance and
                uniting them with the
                Lord.<br>
                The Brahmin lobby claim Kabir was
                born in Banaras to a Brahmin &amp;
                was later brought up by a weaver
                couple-Ali
                Neeru and Neema- of Uttar Pradesh,
                who found the baby abandoned on
                the bank of Lahar Talan in the
                forest. This story
                seems to have been conocted by
                Pandits who often generally claim
                that scholars are born in their
                so-called high
                caste only. SGGS ji does not
                support these claims. SGGS ji on
                Panna 67, 328, 970 and 1364 amply
                clarify and leave no
                doubt whatsoever whom Kabir was.
            </p>
            <p class="black">As he came of age, he was married
                to a God-fearing maiden named Loi.
                She was the daughter of Neti, a
                noble-hearted
                weaver. Kabir and Loi had one son;
                Kamala and one daughter; Kamali.
                Kabir was attracted to Hinduism in
                his younger
                days. His couplets and slokas
                impress upon man to become a good
                human being and treat all other as
                his equal. They
                are very effective in leading a
                person on the path of
                righteousness. According to Kabir,
                all human beings are Divine
                in essence. Thus, they are all
                equal. None of them is either good
                or bad. The same Divine spirit is
                manifested in
                all of them, and all that happens
                here is under His will.</p>
            <p class="black">Whoever dies, let him die such a
                death, that he does not have to
                die again. ||1||<br>
                Besides loving devotion which is
                the main and dominant theme of
                Kabir's Bani as included in SGGS
                ji, his aim was to
                free a man from the evil
                tendencies of ego, deceit, etc.
                based as they are on superstitions
                and futility. He
                criticises casteism, idolatary and
                empty ritualism. He had an undying
                urge to transform a person into a
                being who is
                noble and pious spiritually,
                socially and morally. To achieve
                his mission, Kabir openly
                denounced the false
                superstitions, rituals and
                practtices, in all religions, that
                had no relevance with the
                upliftment of human soul
                with the help of convincing
                examples. In a hymn included at
                Aang 324 of SGGS ji, he ridicules
                the idea that mundan
                (ritual shaving off a Hindu
                child's hair) can lead to
                God-realisation. He says that had
                it been so, the sheep would
                have attained liberation several
                times in its life, since it
                undergoes the same ritual so
                often. Similiarly, he
                counteracts the Brahmin's boast of
                high caste.</p>
            <strong><p class="black">If you are indeed a
                    Brahmin, by thy birth from a
                    Brahmin mother,</br>
                    then why didn't you come by
                    some other way? ||2||<br>
                    With the help of another
                    example, he refused to accept
                    the superior status of
                    Brahmins:</p>
                <p>How is it that you are a
                    Brahmin, and I am of a low
                    social status?</br>
                    How is it that I am formed of
                    blood, and you are made of
                    milk? ||3||</p>
                <p>Says Kabeer, one who
                    contemplates God,</br>
                    is said to be a Brahmin among
                    us. ||4||7||</p></strong>

            According to Bhagat Kabir, high
            family, high caste or high status are
            of no consequences on the path to
            God-realisation, rather they become
            hindrances. In a couplet, Kabir
            teaches mankind the vital message of
            reaching God, with the example from
            everyday life:</p>
            <p class="black">From this simple, but vital
                example, we learn that
                God-realisation requires 3
                constituents:<br>
                <strong>· Guru<br>

                    beastlty temperament of an

                    · Inculcating the humility of
                    an ant</strong></p>
            <p class="black"> Bhagat Kabir has been equally
                straightforward while criticising
                some rtuals of the Muslims. In a
                hymn he states; If
                a Muslim becomes deserving of
                heaven because of the sunnat
                (circumcision): what about their
                women folk?</p>
            <p class="black">According to a reference in S.L.
                Sondhi's book, Sant Kabir, Kabir
                relates an anecdote to make us
                aware of the purity
                of the water of the Ganges.
                Considering the Brahmin's claim
                that the water of the Ganga washes
                off all sins, Kabir
                hands over a bowl of such water to
                the Brahmins, but they refuse on
                the excuse that the bowl had
                become impure
                through the touch of a low caste
                man like Kabir. On this, Kabir
                satirises the Brahmins and says
                that if the water of
                the Ganga fails to keep the bowl
                pure, how can it purify our souls
                from all evils? The Brahmins have
                no answer to
                it.</p>
            <p class="black">Kabir ji was a dauntless mouthpiece
                of truth. His straight forwardness
                and truthful frankness resulted in
                both the
                Hindu Pandits &amp; Muslim Quazis
                (priests of both religions)
                holding grudges against him.
                Consequently at the time
                when Sikander Lodhi arrived in his
                town, Kabir had to suffer many a
                humliation at his hands because of
                the
                instigations given to him against
                Kabir, by the heads of both sects.
                But Kabir did not waiver, and bore
                all tortures
                and humiliations with calmness,
                accepting all these as His will.
                However, Kabir remained firm in
                his views. He has
                referred to this incident in his
                hymn included in the Scripture
                under Gaund measure.</p>
            <p class="black">Many attempts were made to torture
                Kabir to the point of submisson,
                but Kabir ji was headstrong and
                took these
                tortures as His will. Ultimately,
                Sikander Lodhi was impressed by
                his personality, and out of
                respect to his wisdom
                and old age, acquitted him.
                Referring to Kabir's love for the
                Divine, deep faith and reverence
                for Him, Bhai Gurdas
                had said: &quot;Brother! There is
                no difference between Lord Rama
                &amp; Kabir (who has a oneness
                with Him, though
                his bodily vesture gives him a
                separate entity)&quot;.</p>
            <p class="black">The followers of Kabir have come to
                be known as Kabir panthis. They
                have their principle centre at
                Kashi. Two of his
                disciples, Dharam Das and Surat
                Gopal have completed his
                compositions under the title
                'Kabir Bijak'. However, 541
                slokas of Kabir that find a place
                in SGGS ji are considered
                important because of their
                genuineness. Since the entire
                text of the Scripture has ever
                been inviolable, the text of
                Kabir's hymns therein has also
                remained intact and
                unaltered.</p>
            <p class="black">Kabir ever strived to cultivate in
                mankind the feelings of love,
                compassion and co-operation with
                others. Like many
                other great beings, he stressed
                the importance of a householder's
                life because this teaches mankind
                to live together
                and unites man intimately.
                Therefore, he has no hesitation in
                submitting to the Lord the
                'memorandum of demands' for
                a happy household life. i</p>
            <p class="black">Your humble servant shall perform
                Your devotional worship service
                with love. ||3||<br>
                He then goes on to say that he
                doesn't ask for these out of
                greed, rather these are the bare
                essentials of his life
                and none can do without them.
                Through this hymn, Kabir ji has
                beautifully shown us the precept
                of 'hand on job and
                heart in God'.</p>
            <p class="black">Giani Gian Singh, Sikh chronicler,
                writes that Kabir ji &amp; Guru
                Nanak Dev ji met in 1506AD in
                village Pusa; this
                may have occurred during the
                latter years of his life, but
                there is no apparent proof for
                this.</p>
            <p class="blue"> The hymns composed by
                Kabir ji, even during the last
                years of his life when he was well
                over 100 years
                old, reflect his revolutionary
                spirit. According to him, the
                place where God's name is recited
                is pious, and there
                is no other basis of piety. Before
                discarding his bodily vesture,
                Kabir ji shifted his residence to
                Maghar. At the
                time, people believed that he who
                dies at Maghar suffer hell, and
                those that die in Kashi, enter
                heaven. Kabir ji
                braved this revolutionary and
                courageous deed to prove he
                futility of such notions. Guru
                Amar Das ji has strongly
                supported Kabir ji's stand in a
                hymn on Aang 491 of SGGS ji,
                making it clear that visiting
                pilgrimages or breathing
                our last in any certain place
                carries no meaning as God resides
                in the mind.<br>
