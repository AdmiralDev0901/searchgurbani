                Ji was a Sikh Bhagat born in Dhuan
                village in Tantr state, Rajasthan,
                present day
                North West India in about 1415
                From his very childhood, Bhagat
                Dhanna Ji was very simple,
                hardworking and
                straightforward. He always enjoyed
                the company of saints and
                scholars. Bhagat Dhanna Ji is
                shown here serving the
                needly as well as holy men with
                devotion regarding them ALL as the
                embodiment of God.He became a
                follower of Bhagat
                Ramanand. In the beginning he was
                an idol worshipper but at some
                point realized the futility of
                idol worship and
                became a worshipper of Nirgun
                Brahm. Three [Shabad]s of Bhagat
                Ji's Bani are included in the SGGS
                on pages 487, 488
                and 695. Bhagat ji was a farmer by
                trade and was born into a Hindu
                family. From his early childhood,
                he was a very
                simple, hardworking and
                straightforward person. He enjoyed
                the company of saints and
                scholars. He also spent time
                serving the needy and holy men
                with dedication and devotion.</p>

                Dhanna the Jaat applied himself to
                devotional worship. The Lord of
                the Universe met
                him personally; Dhanna was so very
                blessed. ||4||2||&quot;</p>

            <p class="black">SGGS Ang 1192: &quot;Dhanna served
                the Lord, with the innocence of a
                child. Meeting with the Guru,
                Trilochan attained
                the perfection of the Siddhas. The
                Guru blessed Baynee with His
                Divine Illumination. O my mind,
                you too must be the
                Lord`s slave. ||5||&quot;</p>
            <p class="black">The Bhakti movement in India was at
                its peak in the 14th and 15th
                centuries. Several men of God who
                belonged by birth
                to poor families and the so-called
                low castes earned spiritual
                heights and thus gained fame far
                and wide. Many more
                from such lower state of society
                emulated them in pursuit of the
                divine ideal. Dhanna was also one
                such devotee of
                God. Guru Arjan Dev has said that
                Dhanna heard of the fame of
                Namdev, saw for himself the
                spiritual grandeur of
                Kabir, learnt of the uplifted
                spiritual and moral position of
                Ravidas and experienced Sain's
                mystical oneness with
                the Lord. All this inspired in
                Dhanna's heart a deep felt urge to
                realize God.</p>
            <p class="black">Bhagat Dhanna was born in a poor
                Jat (farmer) family in 1415 AD in
                the village of Dhuan in the Tonk
                region of
                Rajputana. He was one of such
                devotees as remain ever absorbed
                in God even when they are
                physically occupied in
                various jobs to earn their
                livelihood. It was this deep
                devotion of Dhanna that ultimately
                enabled him to have a
                glimpse of the Timeless Lord even
                in a stone. Dhanna was a
                simple-hearted ,and noble person,
                and he took seriously
                the advice of a Brahmin to
                consider the stone, Lord Himself.
                He was asked by the Brahmin to
                offer the stone (or the
                Lord in the stone) sacramental
                food. When Dhanna found that the
                Lord in the Act. stone was not
                accepting the food
                offered by him, he declared that
                he himself would not touch the
                food and remain on fast as long as
                the Lord did not
                accept his offer. Bhai Gurdas has
                narrated (Varan, X.1 3) the entire
                episode in a beautiful verse.<br/>
                He says;</p>
            <p class="blue" align="center">Brahmin
                used to worship idols<br/>
                And Dhanna went out to graze cows;<br/>
                When Dhanna saw this all<br/>
                He put queries to Brahmin who
                said: '<br/>
                We who serves the Lord Gets
                fulfilled all desires of his
                heart;<br/>
                Dhanna made supplication to
                him:<br/>
                'Give me one (Idol) if it pleases
                thee<br/>
                Brahmin wrapped a stone in
                cloth<br/>
                And gave it to Dhanna to get rid
                of him,<br/>
                Dhanna first bathed the
                stone,<br/>
                Then offered food and butter-milk;<br/>
                He prayed with folded hands,
                and<br/>
                Prostrated to persuade it accept
                the offer;<br/>
                I will not eat a morsel-<br/>
                Food I relish not if Thou art
                annoyed.'<br/>
                God appeared before the
                Dhanna,<br/>
                Accepted the offering he
                made;<br/>
                Innocent love of Dhanna<br/>
                Thus united him into the Lord.</p>
            <p class="black">A hymn by Guru Arjan Dev included
                in the Guru Granth Sahib on page
                487 narrates the same incident.
                The concluding two
                verses of this hymn are as
                follows;</p>
            <p class="blue" align="center">
                Listening to such happenings,<br/>
                the poor Jat Dhanna too in
                devotion engaged.<br/>
                The Lord to him manifested
                Himself--<br/>
                Such was Dhanna's good fortune. <a
                        href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/488">SGGS-488</a>
            </p>
            <p class="black">The determination and commitment of
                the innocent and pious Dhanna made
                even the Lord yield, and He had to
                take the
                form of Thakur, drink and eat what
                Dhanna had offered Him. Thus did
                Dhanna's unwavering determination
                win, and in
                consequence of this achievement he
                felt deeply committed to God. How
                easy it has been to win the
                pleasure of God
                with one's innocence and simple
                piety. </p>
            <p class="black">The following verse from the Sikh
                Scripture aptly applies to
                Dhanna;</p>
            <p class="black">In innocent spontaneous
                devotion<br/>
                comes meeting with the Lord. <a
                        href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/324">SGGS-324</a>
            </p>
            <p class="black">There are three hymns of Dhanna in
                the Sikh Scripture under Asa and
                Dhanasari measures. In his hymns
                included at page
                487, he says : &quot;O man, you
                have wasted several lives in
                duality from God. Body, wealth and
                material gains are
                ephemeral. The poisonous effect of
                covetousness and indulgence in
                passions have separated man from
                the Creator-Lord.
                It is a matter of deep regret that
                human mind still feels attracted
                towards such sinful passions. He
                is so engrossed
                in realizing material comfort and
                gains that he fails to experience
                the importance of Naam-simran
                (Recitation of
                holy name). Thus, a man must
                endeavour to gather the wealth of
                Divine Name because only such a
                wealth can help in
                his spiritual amelioration.&quot;
                In the other hymn (page 488), he
                exhorts human beings to have
                unwavering faith in
                and devotion to God because only
                these feelings can become a medium
                for their union with God. Dhanna
                expresses his
                unbounded faith in God with the
                help of some examples. He tells us
                that God is omniscient. He brings
                up the smallest
                insects even inside the rocks. He
                provides nourishment to the embryo
                in the mother's womb. Whatsoever
                happens in
                this universe is in His will. Man
                should, therefore, have no fear.
                He must have love for and awe of
                God. He is our
                nourisher, our Patron Father. That
                is why Dhanna offers prayer
                (aarti) in eulogy of the Lord and
                at the same time
                requests Him that a householder
                has numerous needs to be fulfilled
                ; he prays to God for the
                fulfilment of these
                needs. He demands a house to live
                in, a wife to perpetuate the
                lineage, a mare of good breed to
                ride on, and pulses,
                ghee, flour, salt, pepper, etc. to
                fill one's belly. A hymn by Dhanna
                under Dhanasari measure on this
                subject reads
                as under:</p>
            <p class="blue" align="center">Lord!
                Thy servant am I in
                affliction.<br/>
                Those that to Thee are
                devoted,<br/>
                Thou their objectives dost fulfil
                (Pause)<br/>
                I beg for lentils, flour and some
                ghee,<br/>
                Whereby may my heart be delighted.<br/>
                Seek I also shoes and good
                clothing,<br/>
                And grain grown over well-ploughed
                Land.<br/>
                A cow and a buffalo in milk I
                seek,<br/>
                As also a good Arab mare.<br/>
                Thy Servant Dhanna then begs also
                for a wife,<br/>
                a good house keeper. <a

            </p>
            <p class="black">No man of God other than Dhanna or
                Kabir has ever supplicated to God
                with such emphasis for the
                fulfilment of his
                material needs. They are fully
                justified in saying that one can't
                concentrate on God with empty
                stomach because the
                fire of hunger adversely affects
                both the body and soul. In case
                one feels unable to satiate one's
                hunger with food
                morning and evening even after a
                day of hard labour, Kabir in such
                a situation is prepared even to
                give back to God
                the rosary he uses for remembrance
                of His Name.</p>
            <p class="black">As we have already said, Dhanna had
                firm and unswerving faith in the
                omnipotence of God. Dhanna says
                that man must
                have full faith in Him. It will be
                of interest to relate here an
                incident to reiterate such a
                faith. It is said that
                Prophet Moses had deep love for
                God, and he used to climb up the
                Mount and converse with God. Once,
                two gentlemen
                met Moses. One of those gentlemen
                ever remained engaged in Divine
                remembrance and spent his life in
                righteous and
                honest manner. The other fellow
                was given to wine, women and such
                other vices of passion. Because of
                such habits he
                had either no time or inclination
                towards singing eulogies of God.
                Both of these said to Moses that
                he has been
                meeting and conversing with God
                quite often and that he has been
                deeply in love with Him. He should
                therefore
                enquire from God in their behalf,
                whether they would be able to swim
                across the world ocean. Moses
                acceded to their
                request and agreed to put this
                question to God and also to report
                back the answer that God gave to
                their question.
                However, in their heart of hearts
                both of them seemed to know the
                answer. The person given to
                devotion and righteous
                labour was fully satisfied that
                the answer would be in his favour.
                On the other hand he who was given
                to wine and
                women also knew the answer fully
                well himself. Still both of them
                waited for answer from Moses.<img

            <p class="black">At last Moses met them after a few
                days and told them that he had put
                their question to God. Both
                expressed equal
                keenness to know the answer God
                gave him. Moses told that as he
                asked God if person with noble
                deeds would go to
                heaven, He made no reply. When
                Moses sought the same information
                about the other man, God told him
                that a few days
                ago a heavily loaded camel was
                going on its way, and it was in
                excitement. God further told that
                he saw its mischief
                (wickedness), got hold of a needle
                and made the camel pass through
                its eye. That made the camel quite
                calm. That is
                what God said in reply to that
                question and nothing more.</p>
            <p class="black">Moses told them that on hearing
                such a vague answer he began to
                reflect. He wondered how could
                such a huge beast pass
                through the eye of such a small
                needle. But God had told him only
                this much and spoke nothing beyond
                that. On
                hearing this, the devout person
                asked Moses that he was right when
                he wondered as to how can such a
                huge camel pass
                through the eye of a needle : it
                seems obviously impossible.
                Listening to this the other fellow
                made an instant
                reply saying that this can be.
                Nothing is impossible for God. He
                can do whatsoever He wishes none
                can stop Him.
                Camel is a small thing, and He
                can, if He so desires, pass a huge
                mountain through the eye of the
                needle. This is my
                firm faith. On hearing this, Moses
                and the other fellow came to their
                senses- if He is God, He is
                capable of doing
                anything He wishes. We know of the
                indescribable power of God but
                still seem to disbelieve it. And
                this man given to
                the vices of wine and women knows
                nothing about Him but still has
                such a firm faith in His
                omnipotence. He believes
                that God is capable of doing
                anything. This incident made them
                aware that each and everybody can
                win acceptance in
                the Divine court provided he or
                she has deep faith in Him. God
                will not be far away then.</p>
            <p class="black">From the information provided in
                the preceding pages about Dhanna,
                it becomes clear that Dhanna was a
                dear son of God
                who can ask his Father without any
                hesitation and with a sort of
                claim for the f ulfilment of his
                needs. In fact he
                knows how to get even the greatest
                of his needs fulfilled that is
                perhaps the reason which prompts
                Mira Bai to say
                that Dhanna can grow the corn
                without sowing the seed. We come
                across some very significant
                references at several
                places to the effect that the
                bhagats are the dearest sons of
                God. It is also perhaps because of
                the unique miracles
                and deep faith of such men of God
                that Guru Arjan says that such
                devotees (Bhagats) have made the
                Lord a family man
                because they are His loving
                children. Guru Arjan Dev's verse
                on this subject runs as
                follows:</p>
            <p class="red">Blessed is the birth of
                the servant of God,<br/>
                Who the Lord, Rewarder of
                deeds,<br/>
                With progeny has furnished.<br/>
                Along with him all assembled
                groups attain liberation,<br/>
                As saith Nanak: the Supreme Being,<br/>
                Perfection incarnate, has he
                realized <a
                        href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/532">SGGS-532</a>
            </p>
            <p class="black">The life of ignorant Jat Dhanna (as
                he him self describes himself as
                such) was decorated with the
                flowers of piety,
                discourses of love, nobility of
                truth, commitment of faith and the
                service of the Lord rendered with
                heart. He lived
                a life of 60 years and died in
                1475 A.D. Some historians believe
                that Dhanna and Guru Nanak Dev met
                each other at
                Dhhan during the latter's first
                preaching odyssey, but the years
                do not seem to support this
                contention. It is now a
                historically accepted fact that
                Guru Nanak's first odyssey began
                in 1501 AD whereas Dhanna breathed
                his last in
                1475.</p>
            <p class="black"> Mankind can easily achieve the aim
                of God-realization provided it
                follows the footprints of Dhanna.
                The life of
                Dhanna is a clear example in this
                context, and it serves as a good
                and worthy guide. Dhanna has been
                the pride of
                India's religious history because
                of his unique spiritual merit.</p>
