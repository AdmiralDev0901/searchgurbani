                     align="left"/><strong>BHIKHAN</strong>
                (1480-1573), a medieval Indian
                saint two of whose hymns are
                included in
                the Guru Granth Sahib. There are
                in fact two saints of that time
                sharing
                the same name&#8212; Bhakta
                Bhikhan and Bhikhan the Sufi.
                Bhakta Bhikhan
                was a devotee in the tradition of
                Ravid&atilde;s and Dhann&atilde;.
                He
                was born at Kakori near Lucknow in
                present day Uttar Pardesh state.
                His
                hymns in the Guru Granth S&atilde;hib
                reflect his dedication to the Name
                of Hari (God) which he describes
                as &quot;cure for all ills of the
                world.&quot;</p>
            <p class="black">Medicine of the Name Divine in the
                mouth he pours and yama's (demon)
                noose snaps.In the Sikh thought,
                householder's
                life enjoys a place of prominence
                because only a householder can
                aspire to live with others in a
                spirit of humility,
                mutual understanding, cooperation
                and coexistence. The feeling of
                fraternity is also connected with
                the house
                holder's life, and as a result of
                it the house holder's life has
                been accepted as the ideal way to
                realize the ideal
                of service and remembrance of the
                Divine. All the contributors to
                the Guru Granth Sahib advocated
                this point of
                view, and bhagat Nizamuddin
                Bhikhan is one of these
                contributors.</p>
            <p class="black">Bhikhan belonged to the Lucknow
                region in the Uttar Pradesh. He
                was born in AD 1480 in Kakeri
                town. He was the
                disciple of Syed Pir Ibrahim from
                whom he learnt the lesson in
                spiritual and moral values.</p>
            <p class="black">Bhikhan, a medieval Indian Sufi
                saint (A monastic sect of
                Muslims), lived a very simple life
                guided by pious and high
                thinking. Bidauni, an historian
                contemporary of emperor Akbar,
                writes of Bhikhan that he was the
                greatest among
                scholars, but inspite of this he
                used to call himself Kari, i.e., a
                student or learner. Such a humble
                pseudonym
                (assumed name) reflects the
                humility of his heart. On the
                whole, the life of Bhikhan was the
                life of an ideal house
                holder. Being a great scholar and
                intellectual, Bhikhan's fame
                spread far and wide. Soon he came
                under the influence
                of Bhakti movement and thus became
                a bitter critic of futile
                superstitions and formalism.
                Religious label was no
                more of any importance for him. He
                devoted himself completely to the
                One Lord. To him, Divine Name was
                the Panacea
                for all human maladies. Thus, he
                came to develop a deep faith and
                devotion in the Absolute One. He
                was strongly
                against retaining difference in
                one's profession and practice.
                According to him, one who has to
                reach the Divine
                Portal must drink the nectar of
                Divine Name.Following is the
                complete hymn in this context</p>
            <p class="blue" align="center">In the
                old age are the eyes flowing with
                water,<br/>
                the body enfeebled,<br/>
                The hair turned grey,<br/>
                The throat choked, uttering not a
                word<br/>
                What power has man now? (1)<br/>
                Divine King, Lord! turn-you his
                physician now:<br/>
                Save your devotees (1 Pause)<br/>
                The forehead with ache is burning,<br/>
                the heart throbbing with pain
                :<br/>
                Such is the torment that knows no
                remedy.(2)<br/>
                The Name Divine is holy
                amrita-Water-<br/>
                this the whole world's
                remedy,<br/>
                Prayeth Bhikhan, servant of
                God:<br/>
                By the grace of the Master<br/>
                The door of liberation may I
                attain! (3) (1)<br/>
                <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/659">SGGS-659</a>
            </p>
            <p class="black">Two hymns of Bhikhan are included
                in the Guru Granth Sahib on Page
                659. The essence of these hymns is
                that it is
                man's deeds that cause him
                suffering and discontentment.
                Caught in the web of Maya (wealth)
                and love for his body,
                man is engaged in adding patches
                like mending the shoe. He can
                secure liberation from such a
                situation only if God
                bestows His grace on him. Then the
                path to liberation will become
                open to him. Divine grace is
                certainly bestowed on
                him provided he remembers the
                Lord-Curer of all ills of the
                world.<br/>
                In his second hymn which begins by
                calling Name a priceless jewel,
                Bhikhan describes the effect of
                Naam-Simran
                (remembrance of Divine Name) on
                man's body, soul and mind. The
                taste of Name is indescribable,
                says Bhikhan, just as
                a dumb man cannot explain the
                taste of sweets. Reciting His Name
                provides comfort and joy to the
                tongue, and
                remembering Him is comforting for
                the mind. Bhikhan says that his
                eyes have experienced a strange
                coolth by
                remembering the Lord: now
                whichever direction he looks to,
                he perceives the Almighty Lord.
                This Hymn, reads as
                follows:</p>
            <p class="green" align="center">The
                invaluable jewel of the<br/>
                holy Name in reward for good deeds
                have I attained.<br/>
                By innumerable devices in my heart
                have I lodged it<br/>
                Yet this jewel concealed may not
                be. (1)<br/>
                Beyond expression are merits of
                the Lord,<br/>
                As taste of sweets for the dumb.
                (1 pause)<br/>
                In the tongue's utterance,<br/>
                the ears listening to the
                Name,<br/>
                The mind's contemplation, lies
                joy.<br/>
                Saith Bhikhan : Both my eyes now
                are content:<br/>
                Wherever 1 look, Him 1
                behold.-(2)-(2) <a

            </p>
            <p class="black">In both these hymns is found
                expressed the multi-faceted
                admiration of Name. The essence of
                his faith in the
                significance of Name is identical
                with the thought expressed in the
                following verse of the Gurus:</p>
            <p class="black">Of those not cherishing the Lord in
                heart Is all doing tasteless.<a
                        href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/1336">
                    SGGS-1336</a></p>
            <p class="black">Some scholars are under the
                mistaken belief that these two
                hymns as included in the Scripture
                in the name of Bhikhan
                are in fact by Syed Bhikhan Shah,
                a holy-man who spent most of his
                time in the village of Ghuram,
                near Patiala. A
                tomb also stands erected there in
                his memory. Pir Bhikhan Shah of
                Ghuram had been a contemporary of
                Guru Tegh
                Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh. As
                the tradition goes, Bhikhan Shah
                was performing his Namaz (Muslim
                prayer) facing
                west when he learnt of the birth
                of Guru Gobind Singh, and on
                learning this he immediately
                turned eastward (towards
                Patna) to pay obeisance to the
                newly born Guru.</p>
            <p class="black">No doubt, Pir Bhikhan Shah was a
                sufi saint of high spiritual
                merit, but none of his verses is
                included in the Sikh
                Scripture. The holy-man whose
                hymns are included in the Guru
                Granth Sahib has been Bhagat
                Bhikhan who was born at
                Kakeri in Uttar Pradesh and about
                whom it is said that although he
                was Bhikhan by name yet he had the
                heart of an
                emperor. Eulogy of God was his
                profession. He had complete
                control over his senses, and
                remained ever absorbed in
                Divine Name.</p>
            <p class="black">Bhagat Bhikhan breathed his last in
                1631 Bikrami (1574-A.D.), the time
                when Guru Ram Das occupied the
                spiritual
                throne of Guru Nanak.</p>
