                        <p>The next thaat is Khamaj which can be obtained by replacing the Shuddha Nishad of Bilawal by
                            Komal
                            Nishad. The raags of this thaat are full of Shringar Ras (romantic) hence this raag is
                            mostly
                            rendered in the form of light classical thumris, tappas, horis, kajris etc. Its pictorial
                            descriptions in the existing texts are sensuous and even today, the raag Khamaj is
                            considered to be
                            a 'flirtatious' raag. There is another theory which assumes that in the past, Khamaj scale
                            found its
                            way in Ch'in music of the late medieval China. <br/>
