                        <p>Bhairav thaat raags make use of Komal Gandhar and Komal Dhaivat. Bhairav is one of the names
                            of Lord
                            Shiva especially in his powerful form as a naked ascetic with matted locks and body smeared
                            with
                            ashes. The raag too has some of these masculine and scetic attributes in its form and
                            compositions.
                            The raag itself is extremely vast and allows a huge number of note combinations and a great
                            range of
                            emotional qualities from valor to peace. You can see a lot of variations on raag Bhairav
                            including
                            (but not restricted to) Ahir Bhairav, Alam Bhairav, Anand Bhairav, Bairagi Bhairav, Beehad
                            Bhairav,
                            Bhavmat Bhairav, Devata Bhairav, Gauri Bhairav, Nat Bhairav, Shivmat Bhairav. This raag is
                            usually
                            performed in a devotional mood in the early morning hours. The vibrations of the notes in
                            Bhairav is
                            said to clear one's whole mind. The pictorial depictions of raag Bhairav in the ancient
                            texts are
                            austere as well as awe-inspiring.<br/>
