<h2>The Sikh Gurus</h2>


<p align="center"><em><strong>&quot;If a hundred moons were to come out,<br/>
            and a thousand suns were to rise;<br/>
            in spite of all this illumination,<br/>
            all would be pitch dark without the Guru.&quot;</strong></em><strong><em><br/>
        </em>(Guru Angad, 2nd prophet of the Sikhs)</strong></p>
<p>Guru Nanak received a Hukam (commandment) from God instructing him to spread a message of truth based on devotion to
    One God, honesty, and compassion. The soul of Guru Nanak passed on to nine successors, who elaborated on the first
    Guru's teachings to give form to this new religion. The final form was given by the tenth and last Guru, Gobind
    Singh, who started the Sikh initiation ceremony: initiated Sikhs formed a community of saint-soldiers known as
    Khalsa, the Pure Ones. Guru Gobind Singh also made it clear that, after him, the Guru-eternal for Sikhs would be
    their holy scripture, Guru Granth Sahib.</p>

<p align="left">Born in 1469 to a Hindu family near the city of Lahore (now a part of Pakistan), Guru Nanak was the
    founder of Sikhism. The young Nanak enjoyed the company of holy men and engaged them in long discussions about the
    nature of God. Around the year 1500, Nanak had a revelation from God; and shortly thereafter, he uttered the
    words:</p>
<p align="left"><em>There is No Hindu, There is No Muslim</em></p>
<p align="left">This pronouncement was substantial as it referred to the day and age in which Guru Nanak lived: Hindus
    and Muslims of India constantly and bitterly fought each other over the issue of religion. The Guru meant to
    emphasize that, ultimately, in the eyes of God, it is not religion that determines a person's merits, but one's
    actions.</p>
<p align="left">The Guru witnessed the Mughal invasion of India, and saw the horrors inflicted upon the common people by
    the invaders. Though a pacifist, Guru Nanak did not hesitate to speak up against injustice:</p>
<p align="left"><em>The kings are ravenous beasts, their ministers are dogs.</em></p>
<p align="left"><em>The Age is a Knife, and the Kings are Butchers<br/>
        In this dark night of evil, the moon of righteousness is nowhere visible.</em></p>
<p align="left">Guru Nanak laid forth three basic principles by which every human being should abide:<br/>
    1. Remember the name of God at all times.<br/>
    2. Earn an honest living as a householder.<br/>
    3. Share a portion of your earnings with the less fortunate.</p>
<p align="left">Besides rejecting the Hindu caste system, idolatry, and ritualism, Guru Nanak preached universal
    equality. In consistence with his message of equality, Guru Nanak scorned those who considered women to be evil and
    inferior to men by asking:</p>
<p align="left"><em>Why should we call her inferior, when it is she who gives birth to great persons?</em></p>
<p align="left">Guru Nanak has been documented to have traveled across India and the Middle East to spread his message.
    Once, at Mecca, the Guru was resting with his feet pointing toward the holy shrine. When a Muslim priest angrily
    reprimanded the Guru for showing disrespect to God, the Guru replied, &quot;Kindly point my feet toward the place
    where God does not exist.&quot; Among the many philosophical foundations laid by Guru Nanak , his characterization
    of God, as illustrated by his visit to Mecca, is most recognizable. It forms the opening lines of the 1430 page Sikh
    holy scripture, Guru Granth Sahib. The translation is as follows:</p>
<p align="left"><em>There is but One God, The Supreme Truth; The Ultimate Reality, The Creator, Without fear, Without
        enemies, Timeless is His image, Without Birth, Self Created, By His grace revealed.</em></p>
<p align="left">Like all the Gurus after him, Guru Nanak preached by example. During a time of great social disarray and
    religious decay, his message served as a fresh, uncorrupted approach toward spirituality and God. The message of the
    Guru took almost 240 years to unfold, and so, in accordance with the Will of God, the soul of Guru Nanak merged into
    the souls of his nine successors.</p>

    Besides maintaining and upholding the traditions laid forth by Guru Nanak, the second Guru created the Gurmukhi
    script, a medium through which the writings and teachings of the Sikh gurus could be readily understood by their
    followers. By disassociating the Sikh tradition from Sanskrit influence, a script and language largely unknown to
    the masses, the Guru emphasized the universality and widespread accessibility of Sikh religious thought. Moreover,
    it solidified the idea that Sikhism started as a distinct and revealed religion.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://searchgurbani.com/gurus/guruamar.htm">3. GURU AMAR DAS </a><br/>
    The third Sikh Guru reinforced the teachings of the previous Gurus by organizing the construction of twenty-two
    centers of religious learning for the Sikhs. Like his predecessors, he sharply criticized the practice of
    sati<em>, </em>where widows immolated themselves on the funeral pyres of their dead husbands. The Guru also required
    that anyone wishing to meet him would have to first partake in the common kitchen, called Langar, as a sign of
    equality. The Emperor Akbar, Muslim ruler of India, himself followed this tradition before meeting with the Guru.
</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://searchgurbani.com/gurus/gururamdas.htm">4. GURU RAM DAS</a><br/>
    Founder of the city of Amritsar, site of the Golden Temple, Guru Ram Das worked to ensure the city's growth by
    encouraging commercial and trade ventures in the town. Soon, with the city flourishing as a trade center and place
    of pilgrimage, the Sikhs had a distinct religious center of their own.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://searchgurbani.com/gurus/guruarjun.htm">5. GURU ARJAN</a><br/>
    The fifth Guru started the construction of the Golden Temple. To emphasize the universality of Sikhism, the
    foundation stone of the shrine was laid by a Muslim saint, named Mian Mir. Also, the temple featured four entrances
    to represent access to <u>all</u> communities. Guru Arjan compiled the Adi Granth, the Sikh scripture containing the
    writings of all the Gurus up until that time (the writings of the eighth Guru were added by Guru Gobind Singh). As
    another sign of the universality of Sikh philosophy, the Guru added the writings of several Muslim and Hindu saints,
    whose ideas corresponded to Sikh beliefs. With the passage of time, the Guru attracted a substantial following; and
    therefore, the Sikh community assumed a socio-political character. In 1606, Emperor Jehangir, the Muslim ruler of
    India, summoned the Guru to his court on the charge of blessing a rebellious relative of the Emperor's. Upon the
    Guru's refusal to embrace Islam to escape death, the fifth prophet of the Sikh religion was subject to inhumane
    torture and killed. Thus, the martyrdom tradition of Sikhism began with the martyrdom of the Guru himself. From this
    point forward, Sikhism began to form itself into a community of saint-soldiers.</p>

    Responsible for establishing idea of the inseparability of spiritual and temporal matters, the sixth Guru maintained
    an army for the purpose of protecting the poor and destroying tyrants. He constructed the Akal Takht, center of
    temporal affairs in the Sikh religion, across from the Golden Temple in Amritsar. By this time, the Sikh community
    was a full-fledged social, religious, and political entity.</p>

    The seventh Guru continued the mission of organizing the Sikhs into a military force that would be equipped and
    ready, both spiritually and physically, to counter the repressive Mughal empire.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://searchgurbani.com/gurus/guruharkrishan.htm">8. GURU HAR KRISHAN</a><br/>
    At only five years of age, the eighth Sikh Guru was the youngest. He worked to alleviate the suffering of the common
    man during a smallpox epidemic in Delhi, but succumbed to the disease himself at the age of eight.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://searchgurbani.com/gurus/guruteghbhadur.htm">9. GURU TEGH BAHADUR</a><br/>
    The Mughal Emperor of India, Aurangzeb, attempted to consolidate India into one Islamic nation. In order to achieve
    this aim, he set out to virtually eliminate Hinduism from India. When the eighth Guru heard of this from a desperate
    group of Hindus, he challenged the Emperor that, in order to convert all the Hindus, the Guru himself would have to
    embrace Islam. When the Guru was imprisoned at the request of Aurangzeb in 1675, despite being forced to watch the
    torture and execution of two disciples, the Guru simply refused to concede to the Emperor's demand. Finally, the
    Guru was ordered to get beheaded. Unparalleled in the history of humankind, the martyrdom of Guru Teg Bahadur was an
    act of sacrifice for another religious community. The Guru's martyrdom served to awaken the collective conscience of
    the Sikh community, which was about to undergo a final transformation in the years to follow.</p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://searchgurbani.com/gurus/gurugobind.htm">10.GURU GOBIND SINGH</a></p>
<p align="left">Upon the death of his father, Guru Gobind Singh felt compelled to organize the Sikhs into a community of
    saint-soldiers. During the spring of 1699, the Guru called his followers for a special gathering. During the day,
    thousands of people assembled in front of a stage and a tent, out of which emerged the Guru to address the massive
    audience. With sword in hand, the Guru asked the congregation if anyone would be willing to sacrifice their head for
    him. Naturally, the audience was stunned by the Guru's request, and many followers began to disperse out of sheer
    terror. Still, the Guru pressed for one of his followers to give their life for him. Finally, one of the assembled
    stood, with hands folded, and approached the Guru in full submission. The lone disciple was led into the tent by the
    Guru. After some time, the Guru emerged with a blood-stained sword and asked for another head. Overcome with shock,
    the audience could not believe what they were seeing; however, another devoted follower stood and offered his head
    to the Guru. Eventually, with the same outcome, three more devoted disciples offered their lives to the Guru. After
    the fifth devotee was led into the tent, to the surprise of the massive audience, the Guru emerged with the five
    followers fully clothed in the uniform of the Khalsa, or Pure. The Guru's demonstration symbolized a revitalization
    of the Sikh identity and the definitive evolution of the Sikh community into a community of saint-soldiers. After
    initiating the five &quot;beloved ones&quot; into the new order of the Khalsa, the Guru knelt before them and
    requested that they initiate him. In the annals of human history, such a transformation into a distinct and
    solidified community, culminating in the baptism of the prophet by his followers, remains a unique and defining
    moment.</p>
<p align="left">Guru Gobind Singh and his Khalsa army were engaged in several battles against the imperialist Mughal
    army during the Guru's life. Through the course of those turbulent times, the Guru lost his four children and his
    mother to the cause of righteousness; but nevertheless, the Khalsa stood firm as a distinct and sovereign entity,
    able to withstand the onslaught of a mighty enemy.</p>
<p align="left">In the face of persecution, the Guru wrote:</p>
<p align="left"><strong>When all peaceful means of resolution have failed, it is righteous to draw the sword.</strong>
</p>
<p align="left"> Before his death at the hands of an assailant in 1708, the Guru added the writings of Guru Tegh Bahadur
    to the Sikh scriptures, thereby giving a final revision to its form. The Guru also declared the lineage of living
    Gurus finished, and requested his followers to seek spiritual guidance from the <a
        href="http://searchgurbani.com/gurus/gurugranth.htm"><strong>Guru Granth Sahib</strong>.</a> In essence, the
    light of Nanak, the first Guru, was to be forever enshrined within the pages of the <strong><a
            href="http://searchgurbani.com/gurus/gurugranth.htm">Guru Granth Sahib.</a></strong></p>
<p align="left">To illustrate his point that the <strong><a href="http://searchgurbani.com/gurus/gurugranth.htm">Guru
            Granth Sahib</a></strong> was the final Guru of the Sikhs, and as a sign of humility, Guru Gobind Singh did
    not include his writings, over 1400 pages worth of literature, in the <strong><a
            href="http://searchgurbani.com/gurus/gurugranth.htm">Guru Granth Sahib</a></strong><a
        href="http://searchgurbani.com/gurus/gurugranth.htm">.</a> A separate volume, called Dasam Granth, features the
    writings of the tenth Sikh Guru.</p>
