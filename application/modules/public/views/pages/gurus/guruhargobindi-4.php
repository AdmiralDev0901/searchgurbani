        <h2 class="no-top">Sri Guru HarGobind Sahib Ji</h2>
        <p><strong><a name="1" id="1">GURU'S FAMILY:</a></strong></p>
        <p>The Guru had five sons and one daughter. They were:</p>
        <p>Baba Gurditta was born to Mata Damodri in 1613.</p>
        <p>Bibi Viro was born to Mata Damodri in 1615.</p>
        <p>Baba Surj Mal was born to Mata Marwahi in 1617.</p>
        <p>Baba Ani Rai was born to Mata Nanaki in 1618.</p>
        <p>Baba Atal Rai was born to Mata Nanaki in 1619.</p>
        <p>Baba Tegh Bahadur was born to Mata Nanaki in 1621.</p>
        <p>There lived a Sikh, Gurmukh in Amritsar who had the only son, Mohan. Baba Atal and Mohan used to play
            together. One
            day they played until nightfall. The victory remained with Baba Atal and it was agreed upon that the play
            would be
            resumed the next morning. When Mohan went out, he was bitten by a cobra and the boy succumbed to death. Next
            morning
            Baba Atal Rai went to Mohan's house and was told that Mohan was dead. Baba Atal did not believe that he was
            dead and
            he lifted the dead Mohan to life. Upon this the Guru angrily addressed to his son,&quot; You must be working
            miracles, while I teach men to obey God's Will.&quot; Baba Atal replied,&quot; Great King, may you live for
            ages, I
            depart for Sachkhand (heaven).&quot; By saying this, he left and went to bathe in the tank of nectar. After
            his
            ablutions, he circumambulated the Golden Temple four times. As he finished his morning devotions, his light
            blended
            with the Light of God when he was nine years old.</p>
        <p>Guru Har Gobind narrated all the circumstances to his eldest son Gurditta and sent him to Budhan Shah, whose
            devotion
            he commended. Baba Gurditta took his wife Natti and his son Dhir Mal and met Budhan Shah on the bank of
            river
            Satluj. Baba Gurditta reminded,&quot;O priest, thou hast the milk that was entrusted to thee. Bring that to
            me. The
            Guru is my father, and he has sent me to taste it.&quot; Budhan Shah gave the milk and it is said that it
            was as
            fresh as it had been set. Baba Gurditta and his wife Natti continued to reside in Kiratpur. A son was born
            to them
            on January 16, 1630 and they called him Har Rai.</p>

        <p>Bhai Buddha remained in his village of Ramdas intent on his devotions. When he saw his end near, he asked for
            the
            Guru to come and fulfil his promise once he made to him. He told him,&quot;Bhai Buddha, you have lived long,
            you
            have been ever with the Gurus. Give some instruction.&quot; Bhai Buddha replied,&quot;Great King, thou art a
            sun, I
            am a fire-fly before thee. You have come to save me, and to hear my dying words........I have been a servant
            of the
            Guru's house for six generations. Succor me in the next world, and allow me not to suffer when I enter
            death's door,
            which I fondly hope is the portal of salvation. Here is my son, Bhana at your service; take his arm and keep
            him at
            your feet.&quot; The Guru replied,&quot;Bhai Buddha, you shall assuredly obtain bliss. Your humility is an
            assurance.&quot; He then put his hand on Bhai Buddha's head and blessed him who then left for his heavenly
            abode.
            The Guru and his Sikhs sang congratulations on the event of Bhai Buddha's death after his long, holy and
            eventful
            life, and lauded him for the assistance he had given in the propagation and consolidation of Sikh faith. The
            Guru
            himself ignited his funeral pyre.</p>
        <p align="center"></p>
        <p><strong><a name="3" id="3">BHAI GURDAS:</a></strong></p>
        <p>Bhai Gurdas was a contemporary of the fourth, fifth and sixth Gurus and was acquainted with them and their
            contemporaries, especially Bhai Buddha, an aged Sikh who had survived from the time of Guru Nanak. The
            tenets of
            Sikh religion are given in Bhai Gurdas's Vars. There are forty Vars in number and each is divided in varying
            number
            of pauries (stanzas) and each pauri contains from five to ten lines.</p>
        <p>One morning the Guru went to Bhai Gurdas whose end was now approaching. He begged pardon for any sins he
            might have
            committed. The Guru replied,&quot; I thank thee, Bhai Gurdas, for having assisted in laying out the road of
            the Sikh
            faith. Among the Gurus' Sikhs thy name shall be immortal.&quot; Having heard this Bhai Gurdas meditated on
            God and
            drew a sheet over him and closed his eyes in eternal sleep on Friday the fifth day of the light half of
            Bhadon,
            Sambat 1686 (1629 A.D.). After performing the last rites he returned to Amritsar.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><a name="4" id="4">GURU AT KIRATPUR:</a></strong></p>
        <p>He lived in Kiratpur from 1635 to 1644. He chose Kiratpur, a city in the foothill of the Himalayas, which was
            not so
            easily accessible during those days of undeveloped and scanty means of transportation and communication, to
            ward off
            any further hostility between the Sikhs and the Mughal government after the confrontation of four battles.
            There
            were hilly Rajas who were great admirers of the Guru because he was instrumental in getting them released
            from the
            fort of Gwalior and some of them had developed veneration for Sikhism. These are some of the circumstances
            in which
            the Guru seemed to have set up his headquarters at Kiratpur. When he was busy in the battle field, Baba
            Gurditta was
            incharge to look after the organizational work. In 1636 the Guru asked Baba Gurditta to appoint four head
            preachers:
            Almast, Phul, Gonda and Baba Hasna. Almast was made the chief organizer of the proselytizing activities in
            the east.
            Baba Hasna who was the younger brother of Almast, established himself among the people of Pothohar, Kashmir,
            Chhachh
            and Hazara. Similarly Phul and Gonda were assigned the area of Doab to carry on the proselytizing work. All
            these
            four Udasis were founded in their allotted areas, preaching centers which were named as Dhuans or Hearths,
            to
            symbolize the flame of Sikhism. Besides this the Guru sent Bidhi Chand to Bengal. He had sent Bhai Gurdas
            earlier to
            Kabul and then to Banaras to enlighten the people on Guru's gospel and also to encourage trade in
            horses.</p>

        <p>One day Baba Gurditta went for a hunting trip. It so happened that one of his Sikhs shot a cow by mistake for
            a deer.
            The shepherds came and arrested the offending Sikh. Baba Gurditta went to his assistance and offered to give
            compensation. The shepherds would have from the Guru's son (Gurditta) nothing less than the restoration of
            the cow
            to life. If he restored the cow to life, the Guru would be angry as he was before in the case of Baba Atal
            and if he
            refused to satisfy the shepherds, they would detain his Sikh as a hostage. He was at last persuaded to
            reanimate the
            cow. When it was reported to the Guru, he remarked,&quot;It is not pleasing to me that any one should set
            himself up
            as God's equal, and restore life to the dead. Everybody will be bringing the dead to my door, and whom shall
            I
            select for reanimation?&quot; Baba Gurditta replied,&quot; Mayest thou live for ever! I depart.&quot; He
            went to
            Budhan Shah's shrine, drove his cane into the ground, lay down, and left for his heavenly abode at the early
            age of
            twenty- our in 1638.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After this the Guru sent for Baba Gurditta's eldest son, Dhir Mal, from Kartarpur, and also for the Adi
            Granth which
            was in his custody. He intended that the holy volume should be read for the repose of Gurditta's soul, and
            also that
            Dhir Mal should be present to receive a turban after his father's death in token of succession to his
            property and
            position. Dhir Mal declined the invitation saying,&quot;My father is not in Kiratpur. To whom shall I go? It
            is
            through fear of the Guru my father died. I do not desire to die yet. I will myself have the Adi Granth read
            for my
            father.&quot; Thus he kept holy scripture thinking that whosoever had its custody would be the Guru. Bhai
            Bidhi
            Chand had unfinished copy of the Adi Granth which was read at that time. One day the Guru's wife Mata Nanaki
            asked
            him,&quot;O my lord, you always show great kindness to Har Rai, who is your grandson, but you never show
            regard to
            your own son Tegh Bahadur. Fulfil my wishes to put him on your throne.&quot; The Guru replied,&quot; Tegh
            Bahadur is
            a Guru of Gurus. There is none who can endure the unendurable so well as he. He has obtained divine
            knowledge and
            renounced worldly love. If you have patience, the Guruship shall revert to him.&quot;</p>
        <p>A day was appointed for a great assemblage. When all were present, Guru Har Gobind rose, took Har Rai by the
            hand and
            seated him on the throne of Guru Nanak. Bhai Bhana, son of Bhai Buddha, affixed thetilak to Har Rai's
            forehead and
            decorated him with a necklace of flowers. The Guru putting five paise and a coco-nut in front of him, bowed
            before
            him declaring him the Guru, and addressed the Sikhs,&quot;In Har Rai now recognize me. The spiritual power
            of Guru
            Nanak hath entered him.&quot; Upon this the Sikhs shouted congratulations and minstrels began to sing. After
            this
            Guru Har Gobind left this world in March, 1644 at Kiratpur.</p>
        <p>When the last rites were completed, Mata Nanaki and her son Tegh Bahadur set out, according to the Guru's
            order, for
            Bakala, where they both lived until Tegh Bahadur obtained the Guruship.</p>
        <p>FN-1: Wazir Khan was the viceroy of Punjab at the time of Guru Arjan. He was suffering from dropsy and was
            ompletely
            restored to health by hearing the recitation of Sukhmani, upon which he became Guru's follower.</p>
        <p>FN-2: Some writers charge that the Guru was imprisoned on account of money due. If this or any other case was
            the
            cause of his imprisonment, how could he get the release of fifty-two Rajas from the Fort? The Guru was on
            good terms
            with the Emperor. On his illness Jahangir requested the Guru to go to the Gwalior Fort and in return the
            Emperor
            conceded to the Guru's wish to release the princes.</p>
        <p>FN-3:Kahan Singh, a Sikh historian, writes that she was a Hindu girl named Kamla. Qazi Rustam Khan purchased
            er and
            kept her as slave. She was taught Islam.</p>
        <p>FN-4:Some writers say that it was neither Shah Jahan nor the Guru, but there were only their respective
            men.</p>
        <p>FN-5:Some writers say that Bidhi Chand never met the Emperor.</p>
        <p>FN-6: Some writers claim that it was Guru Har Gobind himself who asked Budhan Shah for milk. When Guru Nanak
            met
            Budhan Shah, he offered milk to the Guru as a mark of respect. The Guru promised that he would drink milk
            later on.
            Now Guru Har Gobind reminded Budhan Shah of the milk he promised to drink. Budhan Shah said,&quot;You do not
            look
            like the Guru I gave the milk.&quot; Upon this Guru Har Gobind appeared in the appearance of Guru Nanak
            before
            Budhan Shah and accepted the milk to fulfil the promise.</p>
