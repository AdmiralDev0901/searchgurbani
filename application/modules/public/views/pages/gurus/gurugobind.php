                                    there
                                    was no other individual who could be of more inspiring personality than Guru Gobind
                                    Singh.
                                    At its climax the tenth Nanak infused the spirit of both the saintlihood and the
                                    undauntedness in the minds and hearts of his followers to fight oppression in order
                                    to
                                    restore justice, righteousness (Dharma) and to uplift the down-trodden people in
                                    this world.
                                    It is said that after the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur, the tenth Master declared
                                    that he
                                    would create such a Panth (nation) which would not be cowed down by tyrant rulers
                                    but it
                                    would rather challenge the oppressor in every walk of life to restore justice,
                                    equality and
                                    peace for mankind. He further resolved that he would feel worthy to be called Gobind
                                    Singh
                                    only when any single member of his Khalsa Panth would successfully and undauntedly
                                    challenge
                                    the army of one hundred and twenty-five thousand opponents in the field. This point
                                    was
                                    rightfully proven at Chamkaur Sahib when Sahibzada Ajit Singh (Guru's about 18 years
                                    old
                                    eldest son) challenged the Mughal forces and their allies, the hilly Rajas.</p>

                                    decided in favor of the latter course i.e. to combat evil and uphold righteousness.
                                    He thus
                                    enjoined upon his followers to make use of the sword if all other means failed to

                                    the wicked and his wickedness. In order to achieve this mission, he issued
                                    'Hukamnamas'
                                    (circular letters of authority) to his followers to present to him arms of different

                                    and bore arms and induced others to practise archery and musket- shooting. He
                                    encouraged
                                    various muscle-developing and strenuous sports as part of the program of physical

                                    devotions. He was particularly delighted to listen to Asa di Var. After day-break,
                                    he gave
                                    divine instructions to his Sikhs and then practised martial exercises. In the

                                    received his followers, went shooting or raced horses; and ended the evening by

                                    of the lives and teachings of the Gurus to the growing prince. When Rattan Rai, the
                                    prince,
                                    attained the age of twelve, he felt an inclination to see the Guru. Accordingly he
                                    with his
                                    mother and several of his ministers proceeded to Anandpur. He brought with him an
                                    offering
                                    of five horses with golden trappings, a very small elephant, and a weapon out of
                                    which five
                                    sorts of arms could be made, a pistol, a sword, a lance, a dagger, and a club.</p>
                                <p class="black">The Raja was accorded a great reception. He offered his presents and prayed to the
                                    Guru to
                                    grant him the Sikh faith. He was granted all his desires. The Raja exhibited the
                                    traits of
                                    his presents. He caused the elephant to wipe Guru's shoes and placed them in order
                                    for him.
                                    At the word of command the animal took a chauri and waved it over the Guru. The Raja
                                    requested the Guru never to let the elephant out of his possession.</p>
                                <p class="black">The prince and his party remained at Anandpur for five months and during this time,
                                    he
                                    enjoyed kirtan and Felt uplifted by the Guru's sermons. At the time of departure,
                                    the Guru
                                    accompanied them to some distanceand then bade them good-bye. They were sent off
                                    with
                                    presents. Besides these tangible gifts, the Guru gave Rattan Rai a RATTAN - a jewel
                                    of Nam,
                                    which was the ultimate gift of life:</p>
                                <p>&quot;Nam is the priceless Jewel that the perfect Guru hath;</p>
                                <p>If one dedicates oneself in love to the True Guru,</p>
                                <p>He lights in one's heart the Light of Wisdom, and Nam is then revealed.</p>
                                <p>Blessed is the fortunate one who goeth to meet the Guru.&quot;</p>

                                <p>The Guru's army was swelling day by day and he was now set for the construction of a
                                    big
                                    beating drum which was deemed necessary to enthuse his army and without which he
                                    considered
                                    his equipment was incomplete. The work of the drum was entrusted to his Dewan, Nand
                                    Chand.
                                    In those days, only an independent chieftain was to use such a drum within the
                                    limits of his
                                    territory. The beating of the drum within the bounds of another chief's domain was
                                    an
                                    hostile act and meant an open invitation of war. The completion of the big drum
                                    which was
                                    called Ranjit Nagara, or victorious drum on the battle- field, was celebrated with
                                    prayers
                                    and the distribution of Parshad (sacred food). When it was beaten, the men and women
                                    of the
                                    city came to behold it and there were great rejoicing.</p>
                                <p>The Guru and his men went for hunting the same day and when they reached near
                                    Bilaspur, the
                                    capital of Kahlur, the drum was beaten and it sounded like a thunder to the hillmen
                                    who
                                    became apprehensive of some danger. Raja Bhim Chand of Kahlur consulted his prime
                                    minister
                                    who advised him that it was the Guru's drum who was worthy of worship, secondly, he
                                    maintained a large army and was greatly feared; and thirdly the Guru was brave, and
                                    such men
                                    were sometimes useful as allies. On hearing this Raja Bhim Chand desired to meet the
                                    Guru
                                    and despatched his prime minister to arrange for an interview which was granted. The
                                    Raja
                                    accordingly went with his courtiers to Anandpur.</p></td>
