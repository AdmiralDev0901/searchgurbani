                    <p>Ram Rai was at the Emperor's court in Delhi and when the news of Guru Har Kishen's succession to
                        Guruship
                        reached Ram Rai, he was inflamed with jealousy. The masand Gurdas who attended on Ram Rai
                        comforted him,&quot;
                        There is no need to be sad. Thou hast many disciples in this part of the country. Even the
                        Emperor
                        himself holdeth thee in honor.&quot; Ram Rai was not satisfied,&quot; Knowest thou not, when the
                        Sikhs
                        of this country learn that the Guruship hath been given to my younger brother, they will turn
                        away from
                        me and go to him.&quot; However Ram Rai acted on Gurdas's suggestion and sent his masands in
                        every
                        direction to proclaim his succession and bring him the offerings of the faithful. His masands
                        went in
                        all directions to announce his succession as Guru but the Sikhs who knew Guru's succession,
                        refused to
                        accept Ram Rai as their Guru. At that time Ram Rai decided to lay his case before the Emperor.
                        Thus he
                        addressed Aurangzeb,&quot;Sir, my father has appointed my younger brother as successor to him,
                        and now
                        he has taken possession of his throne, his property and offerings. This misfortune has befallen
                        me on
                        account of my obedience to your Majesty. My father was opposed to you on that account, and at
                        his death
                        he ordered my younger brother never to be reconciled to you, and never to look upon your face.
                        Now I
                        pray thee to summon him to Delhi and order him to exhibit miracles as I have done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This situation provided the Emperor with a good opportunity to realize his own religious mission.
                        Aurangzeb wanted to convert all Hindus to Islam but he apprehended failure in Punjab because the
                        people
                        greatly revered the Guru there. If the Emperor could get Ram Rai the Guruship, and through him
                        he would
                        perhaps be able to spread Islamic faith in Punjab, or even if he were successful to set both
                        brothers at
                        variance, they would die by mutual slaughter, his purpose should be served.</p>
                    <p>Aurangzeb having contrived this wicked plan, called Raja Jai Singh of Amber (Japer) and ordered
                        him to
                        summon Guru Har Kishen and said,&quot; I wish to see him, be careful that he (Guru) be treated
                        with all
                        respect on his journey.&quot; Ram Rai was delighted to hear the Emperor's decision to summon his
                        brother.</p>

                    <p>Many writers have shown their disbelief over the fact that Guru Har Kishen being a child,
                        possessed high
                        attainments and he taught with all the confidence to those who asked him about truth.
                        Intelligentsia
                        cannot understand the sanctity of Guruship as they attribute every happening to age,
                        intelligence and
                        experience of a person. It should be noted here that Guru Har Kishen because of his divine
                        prerogatives,
                        had the spiritual powers at the age of five. His spiritual attainments came with his status of
                        Guruship.
                        As has been explained before, in Sikh Holy Scripture Guru means Jot or Divine Light, once the
                        Guruship
                        is installed, then a person's age, intelligence or experience has no value. It is then the
                        Divine Light
                        that works in that person. The power of Divine Light is beyond the reach of human intelligence.
                        The
                        intelligentsia cannot perceive or apprehend the power of Divine Light through the media of their
                        technical knowledge. Our so called technical knowledge or the intelligence, in reality is
                        'I-am-ness' or
                        the veil of ego. God is everywhere and within us too, but this veil of ego separates us from Him
                        and it
                        hides the truth from us. According to Gurmat, human being as bride and God as bridegroom, live
                        together
                        but the veil of ego separates them. When by the grace of the perfect Guru, this veil of ego is
                        broken,
                        the bride meets the Beloved, God:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Bride and the Bridegroom live together, but the screen of ego hangs in between;</p>
                    <p>When the perfect Guru breaks the veil of ego, O Nanak, we meet our Beloved, God.&quot;</p>
                    <p>(Malar Mohalla 4, p-1263)</p>
                    <p>It is only the Guru's grace that opens up our inner eyes with which we can perceive the
                        Incomprehensible
                        and enter the stage of Eternal Bliss.</p>

                                    Sri Guru Harkrishan Ji was the epitome of sensibility, generosity and courage. There
                                    is a
                                    famous incident from his early age. Once on the way to Delhi from Punjab he met an
                                    arrogant
                                    Brahmin Pundit called Lal Chand in Panjokhara town. The Pundit asked him to recite
                                    Salokas
                                    from the Geeta since his name was similar to that of Lord Krishna. Guru Ji invited a
                                    mute
                                    person called Chhajju Mehra and placed his stick on his head. He immediately started
                                    interpreting salokas from the Geeta. Everybody around was dumbstruck. Lal Chand's
                                    arrogance
                                    too was shattered and he asked for Guru Ji's forgiveness. </p></td>

                    <p>To reach that stage, a person first must seek Guru's grace. In order to do that, one must abandon
                        the
                        sense of egoism and the pride of technical knowledge; and then submit and surrender
                        unconditionally
                        before the Guru and beg for his grace. The answer to the question as to how the Guru at the age
                        of five
                        could possess attainments of such a high magnitude lies not in the reasoning of egoistic mind
                        but in the
                        spiritual vision. The answer to the spiritual power of the young Guru lies in the understanding
                        that the
                        Guru though human in body, is Divine in Spirit. Egoistic minds of the so called scholars
                        prohibit them
                        from understanding the Divinity of the Guru. As long as human mind remains under the
                        intoxication of
                        egoism, the cycle of arguments of intelligence will continue and a person can never perceive the
                        power
                        of Divine Light, cannot comprehend God and can have no knowledge of Him. The egoistic mind will
                        then
                        continue to wonder how a five years old Guru could perform those supernatural acts.</p>
                    <p>Raja Jai Singh had previously heard the Guru's praises and was, therefore, pleased at the
                        prospect of
                        making his acquaintance and of listening to his instruction. He sent his emissary to Kiratpur to
                        request
                        the Guru to come to Delhi. The Guru refused the invitation, for he had been forbidden by his
                        father not
                        to see the Emperor. Raja Jai Singh sent back this communication,&quot; Raja Jai Singh humbly
                        requests
                        the Guru to come to Delhi so that he and the Guru's Sikhs may behold him. The Guru may act as he
                        pleases
                        regarding an interview with the Emperor.&quot; It was made clear by the emissary of Jai Singh
                        that he
                        (Guru) would not be compelled to go to the Emperor.</p>
                    <p>The Guru set out from Kiratpur. On his way he waited for some Sikhs who had come to Kiratpur
                        after his
                        departure. Among them were the maimed and the leprous, all of whom he cured by the imposition of
                        his
                        hands. At Panjokhra, a village near Ambala, came a proud learned Brahman, who without even
                        saluting the
                        Guru, sat down in is presence. He then said,&quot; Thou who callest thyself Sri Har Kishen, must
                        be
                        greater than Lord Krishna. Translate the Gita for me.&quot; At that time, there stood nearby a
                        dumb and
                        illiterate man, Chhaju who hailed from the same village as the Brahman. Chhaju was serving water
                        in the
                        kitchen of the Guru where he had encamped. The Guru asked the Brahman whether he should
                        translate Gita
                        himself or he should get it done from Chhaju. The Brahman thought, Chhaju who could not even
                        talk, how
                        could he translate it? So he replied after a little pause, that Chhaju should do it. The Guru
                        was always
                        carrying a stick with him. He called Chhaju, put his stick on his head and asked him to answer
                        the
                        Brahman's questions. To the utter amazement of the Brahman, Chhaju explained in detail each and
                        every
                        verse that the Brahman asked. Upon this the Brahman fell on the lotus feet of the Guru and
                        apologized
                        for his indiscreet behavior.</p>
                    <p>When the Guru reached Delhi, he was received by Raja Jai Singh who came bare footed to meet the
                        Guru. He
                        requested the Guru to stay at his palace. That palace is now known as Gurudwara Bangla Sahib in
                        New
                        Delhi. Thousands of people of Delhi came to have 'darshan' (holy sight) of the Guru. The sick
                        were
                        healed and those in distress were comforted at the very sight of the holy Master.</p>

                    <p>The Emperor sent presents at the arrival of the Guru and expressed a wish to see him but the
                        invitation
                        as refused. The Guru said,&quot; My elder brother, Ram Rai, is with the Emperor and he will
                        transact all
                        political affairs with His Majesty, and I better not meddle with him. My mission is to preach
                        the true
                        Name. Ram Rai bears enmity with me on account of Guruship, and if the Emperor shows any favor
                        towards me
                        , Ram Rai will become more hostile and grave dissensions in the family may better be avoided.
                        For this
                        and other reasons my father forbade me to meet the Emperor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The next day the Emperor's son, prince Muazzam paid a visit and conveyed his father's desire to
                        see the
                        Guru. The Guru emphasized that he had already given the reason not to see the Emperor. If the
                        Emperor
                        desired any religious instructions, he would give it to the prince. If the Emperor understood
                        the
                        religious instructions and acted upon them, the blessing of Guru Nanak would light on him and he
                        would
                        be happy. The prince asked for the instructions and the Guru dictated the following Sabad of
                        Guru
                        Nanak:</p>
                    <p>&quot;If the True God dwell not in the heart,</p>
                    <p>What is eating, what is clothing,</p>
                    <p>What fruit, what clarified butter and sweet molasses, what fine flour and what meat?</p>
                    <p>What dresses, What a pleasant couch for billing and cooing,</p>
                    <p>What an army, what mace-bearers and servants, and what palaces to dwell in?</p>
                    <p>Nanak, except the true Name all things are perishable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>(Var Majh ki Mohalla 1, p-142)</p>
                    <p>On the instruction of Emperor Aurangzeb, Raja Jai Singh agreed to test the Guru whether he
                        possessed any
                        superhuman power. His head queen dressed like a maid servant and sat among other maid servants
                        and
                        queens. The Guru was requested to identify the head queen (Rani) which he immediately did. Upon
                        this
                        Raja Jai Singh and his queens acknowledged the Guru's spiritual power.</p>
                    <p>Cholera and small-pox were raging fiercely in Delhi at that time. The Guru ordered to spare all
                        the
                        offerings to reduce the suffering of the poor. The food, medicine and clothes were distributed
                        among the
                        poor and the sick. He won many followers in this way.</p>

                        His mother sat by him and pleaded,&quot; My son, why art thou intent on thy death? Thou hast
                        only lately
                        been seated on the Guru's throne, thou art still a child, and it is too soon for thee to depart.&quot;
                        The Guru replied,&quot; Be not anxious. My safety is in His Will. He is the Reaper of His crop;
                        it is
                        His pleasure, and sometimes He reaps it while it is still green, half-green and sometimes when
                        it is
                        ripe. The Creator will do what is best.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Guru was ill for several days. He knew his end had arrived and called for five paise and a
                        coco-nut.
                        He waved his hand three times in the air in token of circumambulating his successor and said,&quot;
                        Baba
                        Bakale,&quot; which meant that his successor would be found at village of Bakala. He then

                        last on 30th of March, 1664. His body was cremated on the bank of river Jamna where now stands
