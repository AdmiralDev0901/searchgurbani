        <h2 class="no-top">Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji</h2>
        <p><strong>GURU AT MEDINA:</strong></p>
        <p class="black">In due time the Guru proceeded to Medina, another holy city of the Muslims where their Prophet Mohammad lived
            for
            many years and breathed his last. He reached at nightfall and stopped outside the town. It happened to be a
            place
            where lepers were segregated and no provision was made for their comfort or treatment. History states that
            the Guru
            healed them all and as a result, the people came in crowds to have holy glimpse of the Guru. After that he
            journeyed
            to Bagdad through Basra.<br/>
        </p>
        <p><a name="11" id="11"></a><strong>GURU AT BAGDAD:</strong></p>
        <p class="black">There lived a very famous Muslim saint, Pir Abdul Kadar who died in Bagdad in 1166 A.D. He was also known as
            Dastgir
            and his successors were called Dastgirs too. The Muslim high priests did not like unethical and immoral
            musical
            verses. Instead of condemning the demoralizing poetry, they outrightly rejected the music ('Rag') itself. So
            according to Muslim Shariat (code of law), music was forbidden. The whole of Sikh scripture is in verse and
            in
            various different forms of Rags and Raginis. In the morning the Guru shouted the call for prayer, on which
            the whole
            population became rapt in silent astonishment. May be he did it differently than the Muslims. Then Mardana
            played
            the rebec and the Guru started the Sabad Kirtan (musical recitation of Gurbani). Whosoever heard was in
            ecstasy. The
            news spread in the city. The high priest Pir Dastgir, another holy man, Bahlol and others came to see the
            Guru.</p>
        <p class="black">According to the Mohammadans there are seven skies above the earth and seven nethers including earth itself.
            The Guru
            began to recite the Japji. When he repeated the twenty-second pauri (stanza) of Japji, the Pir got
            wonder-stuck
            hearing something contrary to the authority of the holy Quran, that there were hundreds of thousands of
            nethers and
            upper regions, and that at last men grew weary of searching for them. The Pir then called upon the Guru to
            give a
            manifestation of what he said. Upon this it is said, the Guru laid his hand on the priest's son and showed
            him upper
            and lower regions described in Japji- pauri 22. To prove whether the boy actually saw those regions, he
            brought
            Parshad (sacred food) from one of those regions and gave it to his father. Both the Pir and Bahlol bowed
            before the
            Guru and asked for his blessings.</p>
        <p class="black">Bahlol became Guru's follower. It is said that he spent sixty years at the foot of the slab, where the sacred
            feet of
            the Guru had rested during their discussion. Later on a shrine was built there in the memory of the Guru.
            The
            English translation of the inscription on the slab inside the shrine is: </p>
        <p class="black">Swami Anand Acharya of Sweden mentions in his book 'Snow Bird', published by Macmillan &amp; Sons, London,
            that
            during his visit to Bagdad, he found another inscription on the slab, dated 917 Hijri. The inscription
            reads: </p>
        <p align="center"></p>
        <p><a name="12" id="12"></a><strong>RETURN FROM BAGDAD:</strong></p>
        <p class="black">From Bagdad the Guru passed through Iran, Turkstan and Afghanistan and then reached Kabul. Some writers
            believe that
            the Guru took the popular route from Bagdad towards Tehran, Kandhar and reached Kabul. On his way he passed
            through
            Mehds. Bhai Mani Singh's Janamsakhi makes a reference of his visit to this place. Since the visit of Guru
            Nanak to
            Kabul, the Sikh contacts had been carefully maintained. Sikh preachers were stationed there to disseminate
            the
            teachings of the Guru. At one time Bhai Gurdas also served as one of the Sikh missionaries at Kabul.</p>
        <p class="black">From Kabul the Guru proceeded to Jalalabad, Sultanpur and passed through Khyber Pass to reach Peshawar. There
            are
            Gurdwaras at Jalalabad and Sultanpur to mark his visit. There are springs of water associated with his
            visit. The
            Guru paid a visit to the Gorakh Hatri and had discourse with Jogis. He also went to Hassan Abdal, now known
            as Panja
            Sahib, and sat at the foot of the hill.<br/>
        </p>
        <p><a name="13" id="13"></a><strong>GURU NANAK AND VALI KANDHARI:</strong></p>
        <p class="black">On the top of a small hill, there lived a Muslim Faqir called Vali Kandhari who was well-known in the area
            for
            possessing miraculous powers. Mardana needed water which could only be obtained from Vali. Mardana told Vali
            that
            Guru Nanak had arrived and he advised him to see the Guru, who was a great saint of God. Vali who claimed
            holiness
            exclusively for himself, became offended on hearing the Guru's praises. He refused to give water saying that
            if the
            Guru were such a holy man, he could provide water to Mardana. When this reply was communicated to the Guru,
            he sent
            Mardana back to the Vali with a message that he (Guru) was a poor creature of God, and laid no claims to be
            a saint.
            The Vali paid no heed to this protestation and still refused to provide water.</p>
        <p class="black">Upon this the Guru picked up one stone and a stream of water immediately issued forth. In fact this water
            came out
            from the Vali's tank which dried up. This naturally increased Vali's rage and it is said that through his
            miraculous
            powers he hurled a small hillock upon Guru Nanak's unoffending head. The Guru, on seeing the descending
            hillock,
            held up his right hand, and as it touched the hand of the Divine Master, the hillock came to a standstill.
            With the
            divine touch, the stone melted and softened like wax and left the mark of the Master's palm indelibly deep
            into it.
            Vali Kandhari was very much astonished and at last fell at the feet of the Guru and begged for forgiveness.
            The Guru
            expressed,&quot;O friend, those who live so high, should not be hard at heart like a stone.&quot; Vali was
            blessed
            by the Master.</p>
        <p class="black">The imprint of the Guru's hand (Punja) is still visible on the stone and the pool of crystal clear water
            still flows
            from there. There stands a Gurdwara which is known as 'Punja Sahib'. It is now situated in west
            Pakistan.</p>
