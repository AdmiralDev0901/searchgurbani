        <p>ABOLITION OF SATI</p>
        <p class="black">The status of women in Hindu society at that time was very low. When the husband died, the wife either
            voluntarily
            burnt herself on the pyre of her husband or was thrown into the fire without her consent. In popular term
            the woman
            who did perform this act was called Sati (truthful). Guru Amar Das carried out a vigorous campaign against
            the
            practice of Sati. He gave special attention to the improvement of the status of women and thus prohibited
            this
            practice. G.B. Scott acclaims the Guru as the first reformer who condemned the prevailing Hindu practice of
            Sati.
            The Guru advocated the following:</p>
        <p class="black">&quot;Satis are not those who are burnt with husbands, O Nanak, true Satis are whom pangs of separation can
            finish.
            Those are considered Satis who live contented, embellish themselves with good conduct;</p>
        <p>And cherish the Lord ever and call on Him.&quot;</p>
        <p>(Var Suhi ki- Slok Mohalla 3, p-787)</p>
        <p class="black">The Guru lifted the status of women as equal to men. He prohibited the practice of Sati and preached in favor
            of
            widow marriage.</p>

        <p>The Guru's following increased considerably. Steps were taken to organize the scattered congregation into a
            unified
            whole which was called Manji system. His whole spiritual domain took the shape of 22 Manjis (dioceses). It
            was so
            named because the in charge of a Manji sat on a cot (called Manji in Punjabi) to deliver the message of the
            Guru.
            The in charge of each and every Manji was a devoted Sikh who was blessed by the Guru before he was appointed
            to that
            position. His function was to preach the mission of the Guru, to keep the Sangat (congregation) in touch
            with the
            Guru and he was also responsible for the offerings of the Sikhs which they made in token of their reverence
            to the
            Guru. The following were the twenty-two Manjis:</p>
        <p>1.<strong> Alayar:</strong> Alayar also called Allah Shah was a Pathan trader whose story has been given

        <p>2.<strong> Sachan Sach:</strong> He was a Brahman from Mandar village in Lahore district. He always used the
            word
            'Sachan Sach' and so he was called Sachan Sach. One of the queens of Raja of Haripur became insane, and by
            the grace
            of the Guru, she recovered her sanity. The Guru married her to Sachan Sach. The couple preached Sikhism.</p>
        <p>3.<strong> Sadharan</strong>: He was an inhabitant of Goindwal and was given a Manji for his devotion to the

            around his area.</p>
        <p class="black">14. <strong>Beni: </strong>He was a learned Pandit of Chunian in Lahore district. He was proud of his
            knowledge of
            Hindu Shastras and he defeated many in the debate of that knowledge. When he came to Goindwal, he fell on
            the feet
            of the Guru and became his Sikh. The Guru entrusted him with the fourteenth Manji.</p>
        <p>15.<strong> Mahesa:</strong> He was an inhabitant of Sultanpur and he performed missionary work in that area.

            the Bawli
            and then revived by the Guru, the Sikhs called him Marjiwra- the revived after death. His generation is
            called
            Marjiwre in Vairowal village in Amritsar district. Manak Chand was made a spiritual guide to Mai Das by the
            Guru.

            and he
            was a leper. He heard about Guru Amar Das and came crawling all the way to Goindwal. By the grace of the
            Guru, he
            was fully healed. He was renamed as Murari. The Guru married him to Matho, daughter of Bhai Sihan. He was
            then sent
            out as one of the itinerant preachers of the Guru's gospel.</p>
        <p>19.<strong> Raja Ram:</strong> He was a Brahman. He became Guru's Sikh. His generation now lives in Sandhma

        <p class="black">Guru Amar Das established another organization called Piri system. The incharges of the Piris were ladies
            whose
            objective was to lit the flame of Guru's word and spread the fragrance of Nam among women. Bibi Bhani, Bibi
            Dani and
            Bibi Pal were some of the most revered incharges of the different Piris. Guru Amar Das gave authority and
            power to
            146 of his apostles to go to various parts of the country and unfold the glory of Nam. Out of these 146
            persons, 94
            were men and 52 were women. They were all glowing with Nam and filled with Divine Spirit.</p>
        <p><a name="ANAND" id="ANAND"></a>COMPOSITION OF ANAND SAHIB</p>
        <p class="black">One day a Sidh Jogi came to the Guru and complained that he performed every form of penance but did not
            obtain any
            peace of mind. He further showed his desire to abandon his body to be reborn in Guru's family so that he be
            happy
            worshipping God and singing His praises. His wish was granted. The Guru had two sons, Mohan and Mohri.
            Mohri's
            eldest son was Arth Mal and it is said that this Sidh Jogi was reborn as Mohri's second son. When the Guru
            heard of
            the Jogi's rebirth, he sent Bhai Ballu to bring the infant to him.</p>
        <p class="black">On seeing the child, the Guru uttered the composition of Anand (Ramkali Mohalla 3, Anand) or the Song of Joy,
            and
            called the child, Anand. This composition (Anand Sahib) is now recited on the occasions of marriages and
            rejoicing.</p>

        <p class="black">It should be remembered that Guru's eldest daughter, Bibi Dani was married to Rama who was a zealous Sikh. He
            used to
            work in Guru's kitchen and administer to the needs of the pilgrims. Jetha was his younger son-in-law. One
            day the
            Guru asked Rama and Jetha,&quot;Each one of you make a platform by the side of Bawli. I will sit on one in
            the
            morning and on the other in the evening.&quot; When the platforms were completed, the Guru went to inspect
            them.
            Rama showed his work and thought that he had done well. The Guru told Rama,&quot;Your platform is not
            straight,
            bring it down and rebuild it.&quot; Rama dissented but rebuilt another one. It still failed to please the
            Guru. Rama
            after long argument, pulled the platform down but refused to build it third time.</p>
        <p class="black">The Guru inspected Jetha's platform and said,&quot;Jetha, I do not like it. Demolish it and build another
            one.&quot;
            Jetha built the second one which was also not of Guru's liking. He demolished it and rebuilt it. The Guru
            continued
            to find fault with it until it was destroyed and rebuilt seven times. Jetha then fell at Guru's feet and
            begged,
            &quot;I am a fool and lack understanding, while thou possesseth all knowledge. kindly bless me with the
            wisdom so
            that I may be able to erect the platform of your liking.&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">On hearing this the Guru smiled and embraced Jetha and commented,&quot; Obeying my order, you have built the
            platform
            seven times, so seven generations of thine shall sit on the throne of Guru Nanak.&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">Bibi Bhani, Guru's youngest daughter, used to attend her father. She used to fan him, draw water and work in
            the
            kitchen. One day the Guru was sitting on his couch (chauki) in deep meditation, when Bibi Bhani noticed that
            one leg
            of his couch had broken. Fearing that his meditation would be disturbed, she put her arm in place of the
            broken leg
            to support the couch. When the Guru opened his eyes, he found blood coming out of Bibi Bhani's arm. On
            inquiry Bibi
            explained that broken leg might have caused disturbance in his meditation and so she thought herself
            fortunate to
            serve Guru by substituting her arm for the broken leg of the couch. The Guru commented,&quot; Whosoever does
            good
            work, shall reap the reward thereof.&quot; He invited her to ask for any favor. She humbly requested that
            the
            Guruship should remain in her family. It is believed that the Guru told Bibi Bhani that the Guruship was not
            a bed
            of roses and he warned her of the trouble and torture that the later Gurus would have to go through. Bibi
            Bhani
            agreed to embrace all those troubles, and again requested to grant her the wish that the Guruship would
            remain in
            her family. So far the Guruship was earned by obedience and devotion to the Guru. Here again Bibi Bhani
            earned it,
            for her family, with her devotion and sacrifice. The Guru granted her the wish and the Guruship thereafter
            remained
            in Bibi Bhani's family.</p>
        <p class="black">Guru Nanak appointed his successor at Kartarpur but asked him to go and live at Khadur. Guru Angad asked his
            successor, Guru Amar Das to live in Goindwal. Guru Amar Das asked Jetha to search for a place other than
            Goindwal as
            a residence for the Sikhs. Jetha found an open land about 25 miles from Goindwal, and he established himself
            there.
            He built a house for himself and got a tank excavated which was called Santokhsar. It is also believed that
            the Guru
            asked Jetha to excavate another tank towards the east which would be called Amritsar- tank of nectar.</p>
        <p><a name="SUCCESSION" id="SUCCESSION"></a>SUCCESSION OF GURU RAM DAS</p>
        <p class="black">Guru Amar Das having tested Jethaji in every way, found him perfect and asked for special congregation. Then
            he asked
            Bhai Ballu to bring coco-nut and five paise. He asked Jethaji to bathe and clothe in new raiment. Then the
            Guru
            descended from his throne and made Jethaji seat on it and called him Guru Ram Das. Bhai Buddha, according to
            the
            custom, attached the tilak of Sovereignty to Guru Ram Das's forehead.</p>
        <p class="black">Among great rejoicing, all Sikhs made offerings according to their means and saluted Guru Ram Das on his
            appointment.
            This ceremony was performed on August 30, 1574 at Goindwal.</p>

            praises, read God's Word (Gurbani), hear God's Word and obey God's Will.&quot; On the first of September,
