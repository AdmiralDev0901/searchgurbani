                <p class="black">Guru Nanak was born in 1469 at Rai Bhoeki Talwandi now nown as Nankana Sahib situated
                    in
                    Punjab
                    province of West Pakistan. This place is about 55 miles north-west of Lahore. His father, Mehta Kalu
                    was a
                    Patwari- an accountant of land revenue in the government. Guru's mother was Mata Tripta and he had
                    one older
                    sister, Bibi Nanki. From the very childhood, Bibi Nanki saw in him the Light of God but she did not
                    reveal
                    this secret to anyone. She is known as the first disciple of Guru Nanak.</p>

        <p class="black"><a name="GURU'S SCHOOLING" id="GURU'S SCHOOLING"><strong>GURU'S SCHOOLING</strong></a><br/>
            At the age of seven, Guru Nanak was sent to school, which was run by teacher, Pandit Gopal Das, at his
            village.
            As usual the teacher started the lesson with an alphabet but the teacher was wonder-stuck when the Guru
            asked
            him to explain the meanings of the letters of the alphabet. However at the helplessness of his teacher, the
            Guru
            wrote the meanings of each and every letter of the alphabet. This was the first Divine Message delivered by
            Guru
            Nanak. This was an explanation of deeper truth about human beings and God and the way to realize God in
            terms of
            the alphabet. The teacher stood abashed before the Divine Master and bowed to him. He then took him back to
            his
            father and said, &quot;Mehtaji, your son is an Avtar (prophet) and has come to redeem the victims of Kalyug
            (the
            age of Falsehood). He is destined to be a world Teacher, there is nothing that I can teach him.&quot;
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Many writers believe that Guru Nanak was first sent to different schools belonging to the Hindus and Muslims
            to
            learn about Vedas (Hindu Scriptures) and Quran (Muslim Scripture), and only after obtaining the knowledge
            from
            those scriptures, he started his religion. According to Malcolm, Guru Nanak is said to have learnt all
            earthly
            scenes from Khizr -the Prophet Elias. &quot;There is a reason to believe,&quot; writes Cunningham, &quot;that
            in
            his youth he made himself familiar with the popular creeds both of Mohammadans and the Hindus and that he
            gained
            a general knowledge of the Quran and Brahmanical Shastras.&quot;
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It seems that all these scholars of history have not grasped the basic fundamental fact about the divinity
            of
            Guru Nanak. He was born with divine status, thus, his teachings were heavenly. These writers seem to be very
            much ignorant of the fact that Guru Nanak was an Embodiment of Divine Light. He was a celestial being and
            his
            divine attributes put him above mankind and its schools. Historians have failed to visualize the splendor in
            Guru's Jot. Heavenly Spirit does not learn from man-made institutions. He was a heavenly messenger and a
            born
            world teacher who taught the mankind the path of righteousness and truth. Guru Nanak's divinity is above all
            earthly institutions and their teachings. The Message that Guru Nanak gave to this world, came to him direct
            from God as he confirms himself:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            &quot;O Lalo as comes the Divine Word from God to me So do I narrate it.&quot; (Tilang Mohalla 1,
            p-722)<br/>
            <br/>
            &quot;I am saying what He commandeth me to say.&quot; (Wadhans Mohalla 1, p-566)<br/>
            <br/>
            It is also mentioned in the Janamsakhi (biography) that many times Guru Nanak said to his companion Mardana,
            &quot;Mardana, play the rebec, the Divine Word is coming.&quot; This confirms the fact that education from
            the
            Hindu and Muslim religious institutions, had no bearing at all on the Divine Word that Guru Nanak received
            from
            God and delivered to this world. To say that Guru went to different institutions to learn, is violating the
            sanctity of Guruship.

        <p class="black"><strong><a name="SACRED THREAD" id="SACRED THREAD">CEREMONY OF SACRED THREAD</a><br/>
            </strong><br/>
            Guru Nanak was nine years old and according to the custom among the higher castes of Hindus, he was required
            to
            invest himself with the sacred thread called 'Janaeu'. Great preparations were made by his father for this
            ceremony.
            The family priest named Hardyal, started chanting Mantras (Hindu hymns) and was ready to put the thread
            around
            Guru's neck when he refused to wear it. The whole assembly was astonished. They tried to persuade him every
            way to
            wear the Janaeu but in vain. Then the Guru uttered the following Sabad:<br/>

                <br/>
                The priest in utter despair asked, &quot;What kind of sacred thread O Nanak, would you wear?&quot; The
                Guru
                replied,<br/>
                <br/>
                &quot;Out of the cotton of compassion<br/>
                <br/>
                Spin the thread of contentment<br/>
                <br/>
                Tie knots of continence,<br/>
                <br/>
                Give it twist of truth.<br/>
                <br/>
                That would make a Janaeu for the soul,<br/>
                <br/>
                If thou have it, O Brahman, put it on me.<br/>

        <p class="black">As usually is the case in villages, the father sent his son to graze the buffaloes in the
            pastures. One
            day while the Guru was grazing the buffaloes, he fell asleep under a tree and the herd destroyed the crops
            in the
            neighboring fields. When the owner saw his crops damaged, he became furious and lodged a complaint with Rai
            Bular,
            an officer-in-charge of that area. Rai Bular sent for the son and his father to adjust the quarrel. The Guru
            told
            them that no damage was done to the crops; rather it was blessed by God. Rai Bular sent his messengers to
            inspect
            the fields. But to everybody's surprise the investigators could not find any damage in the fields rather the
            crops
            were doubly blossoming. The field where this miracle happened is now known as Kiara Sahib.</p>
        <p class="black"> On another day the Guru was sent to graze the buffaloes in the pastures and he fell asleep
            under the
            shade of a tree. As the sun rose higher, the shadow moved away. A big cobra came out of its den and provided
            shadow
            with its hood over the face of the Divine Master. Rai Bular happened to pass by that side with his
            attendants. When
            he saw this strange scene, he was convinced that the boy was a man of God. Upon seeing the people, the cobra
            retreated to its den and Rai Bular touched Guru's feet in great reverence and thus became Guru's
            disciple.</p>
        <p align="left"><a name="SECLUSION" id="SECLUSION"><strong>GURU SITS IN SECLUSION</strong></a></p>
        <p class="black">As he grew a little older, he avoided company and sought seclusion. For days he would sit
            silent
            in
            solitude and spent his time in meditation. Parents became anxious about his health and to them his
            unworldliness
            appeared insane. One day they sent for their physician Hari Das. The physician came and began to feel Guru's
            pulse.
            He withdrew his arm and asked, &quot;O physician, what art thou doing?&quot; The physician replied that he
            was
            diagnosing his disease. Upon this the Guru laughed and then uttered the following Sabad:<br/>
            <br/>
            <em>&quot;They have sent for the physician for me!<br/>
                <br/>
                He taketh my hand and feeleth my pulse.<br/>
                <br/>
                What can a pulse disclose?<br/>
                <br/>
                The pain lies deep in the heart.<br/>
                <br/>
                Physician, go back and heal thyself,<br/>
                <br/>
                Diagnose thy own disease,<br/>
                <br/>
                Then thou mayst diagnose the disease of others<br/>
                <br/>
                And call thyself a physician.&quot; (Malar ki Var, Mohalla 1 p-1279)</em><br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Hari Das was familiar with such cases of deranged mind and thus asked, &quot;So you think that I am sick too
            and
            need a cure.&quot; The Guru replied, &quot;You suffer from the sickness of your soul. Egoism is the disease.
            It
            separates us from the source of life, God Himself.&quot; Hari Das asked if there was any remedy. The Guru
            replied,<br/>
            <br/>
            <em>&quot;When man shall possess the Name of the Bright One,<br/>
                <br/>
                His body shall become like gold and his soul be made pure;<br/>
                <br/>
                All his pain and disease shall be dispelled,<br/>
                <br/>
                And he shall be saved, Nanak, by the true Name.&quot; (Malar Mohalla 1, p-1256)</em><br/>
            <br/>
            After a good deal of discussion, Hari Das bowed before the Divine Master and told his parents to leave
            anxiety about
            their son as he was born 'A healer of the world's sickened souls.'</p>
