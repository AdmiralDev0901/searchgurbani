                <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>Guru Har Gobind was born to Guru Arjan Dev on June 19, 1595
                        at
                        Wadali, a village near Amritsar. The period of Guru's early life is alluded to in the previous
                        chapter.
                        After the Martyrdom of his father (Guru Arjan), the Guru caused the Adi Granth to be read by
                        Bhai Buddha
                        and the musicians of the temple sang the Guru's hymns. This lasted for ten days. When the final
                        rites
                        were over, Bhai Buddha started the ceremony of Guruship. It should be remembered here that when
                        Guru
                        Arjan's wife went to Bhai Buddha for boon of a son, she had prepared the meals with her own
                        hands, and
                        she took bread with onions. Bhai Buddha while &nbsp;eating had said,&quot; The Guru is the owner
                        of the
                        storehouse, but I have received an order to open it. As you have given me food to my heart's
                        content, so
                        shall you have a son to your heart's content. He shall be very handsome and brave, possess
                        spiritual and
                        temporal power, become a mighty hunter, ride on royal steeds, wear two swords, be puissant in
                        battle,
                        and trample on the Mughals. As I crush these onions you have brought to me, so shall your son
                        crush the
                        heads of his enemies,</p>
                    <p>and be at once a great warrior and exalted Guru. His shall not be the humble seat of a village
                        Guru, but
                        a gorgeous imperial throne.&quot; As usual Bhai Buddha placed before the Guru a seli (a woolen
                        cord worn
                        as a necklace or twisted round the head by the former Gurus) and a turban, as appurtenances of
                        his
                        calling. The Guru ordered the seli to be placed in the treasury and reminding him about his
                        prophecy
                        said to Bhai Buddha,&quot;My endeavors shall be to fulfil thy prophecy. My seli shall be a
                        swordbelt,
                        and I shall wear my turban with a royal aigrette. Give me a sword to wear instead of seli.&quot;
                        The
                        sword was brought but Bhai Buddha placed it on the wrong side of Guru Har Gobind. The Guru said,&quot;Bring
                        another one, I shall wear two swords.&quot; He wore two swords which were emblems of Spiritual
                        and
                        Temporal authority- Piri and Miri- the combination of 'Bhakti and Shakti'. </p>
                    <p><strong><a name="1" id="1">AKAL TAKHAT:</a></strong></p>
                    <p>The martyrdom of Guru Arjan was an unparallel act in the history of mankind. The Guru had all the
                        superpowers. He could have averted the situation in any way he liked, but he went through all
                        that
                        torture to show to the world how in all thick and thin one should cheerfully submit to the sweet
                        Will of
                        God. As a atter of fact, the contents of the Adi Granth were not meant for the Yogis, Sidhas and
                        Sanyasis or the Muslim Suffis only, who sit in seclusion in the caves of the Himalayas and
                        worship the
                        Almighty by denouncing the world. Instead the teachings of the Adi Granth were meant for the
                        family men.
                        Leading the family life, the Gurus gave practical examples as how to live according to Guru's
                        Word.</p>
                    <p>The cruel and torturous execution of Guru Arjan aroused a very strong wave of angry feelings
                        among the
                        masses. The enlightened, but not passive, sufferings of the Guru instilled a new spirit and life
                        into
                        the people and they resolved to exert and sacrifice themselves for the sake of righteousness.
                        For
                        centuries, countless Hindu men, women and children had fallen under the Muslim sword and this
                        did not
                        soften the stone hearts of their oppressors; but rather they had become more cruel and brutal.
                        Sometimes
                        it might be possible to reform the evil doer by opposing untruth and injustice through
                        non-violent
                        methods. The silent resistance and suffering for righteous cause might sometimes enable the
                        tyrant to
                        see his evil actions and he might be improved. History stands witness that no amount of non-
                        violence
                        can succeed against a tyrant who is hardened and steeped in criminal oppressive ways and who
                        pays no
                        heed to basic values of moral and civilized conduct. Against such men, non-violence is only
                        another name
                        of disgraceful cowardice in their dictionary. Such power drunk men must be faced bravely with a
                        stick
                        bigger than theirs. After the inauguration, some Masands represented to the Guru's mother that
                        the
                        preceding five Gurus never handled arms; if Emperor Jahangir heard about this, he would be angry
                        and
                        where would they (Sikhs) hide? She showed courage to the Masands, however, she remonstrated with
                        the
                        young Guru,&quot;My son, we have no treasure, no state revenue, no landed property and no army.
                        If you
                        walk in the way of your father and grandfather, you will be happy.&quot; The Guru recited the
                        following
                        verse:</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Lord who is the Searcher of all hearts Is my own Guardian.&quot;</p>
                    <p>(Bhairon Mohalla 5, p-1136)</p>
                    <p>and said,&quot;Have no anxiety and everything shall be according to the Will of God.&quot;</p>

                                    snake-charmer was bribed who let loose a poisonous snake. But the Great Guru
                                    overpowered the
                                    snake. </p></td>

                    <p>The Guru issued an order to the Masands that he would be pleased with those who brought offerings
                        of arms
                        and horses instead of money. He laid down the foundation of Akal Takhat (Timeless Throne) in
                        1606 (the
                        fifth day of light half of month of Har, Sambat 1663) just in front of Hari Mandar, and it was
                        completed
                        in 1609. Akal Takhat was built of solid bricks on a raised platform of about ten feet in height
                        and
                        looked like a throne. The Guru took his seat on it. He built Akal Takhat a few yards in front of
                        Hari
                        Mandar with a view that a Sikh at Akal Takhat should not forget that spiritual elevation was as
                        essential as his social obligations. As a matter of fact, the Guru wanted his followers to be
                        'saint-soldiers', extremely cultured, highly moral with spiritual height and be ever-ready to
                        measure
                        swords with demonic forces. Bhai Buddha on seeing the Guru in military harness, mildly
                        remonstrated with
                        him. Instead the Guru replied,&quot;In the Guru's house religion and worldly enjoyment shall be
                        combined- the caldron to supply the poor and the needy, and the scimitar to smite the
                        oppressors.&quot;
                        (This should be noted by those Sikhs who say that worldly and practical affairs should be kept
                        separate
                        from religion in our Gurdwaras).</p>
                    <p>Several warriors and wrestlers came to the Guru for service. He enrolled fifty-two heroes as his
                        body-guard and this formed the nucleus of his future army. About five hundred young persons came
                        from
                        all over the Punjab to enlist in his service. He made Bhai Bidhi Chand, Bhai Jetha, Bhai Piara,
                        Bhai
                        Langaha, and Bhai Pirana, each captain of a troop of one hundred horse. People began to wonder
                        how the
                        Guru could continue to maintain such an army. The Guru quoted:</p>
                    <p>&quot;God provideth every one with his daily food; why, O man, art thou immersed planning;</p>
                    <p>He putteth their food even before the insects which He created in rocks and stones.&quot;</p>
                    <p>(Gujri Mohalla 5, p-495)</p>
                    <p>Akal Takhat grew into an institution which symbolized in itself the idea that the use of sword
                        for the
                        protection of righteousness and for self-defence was called for. Here the Guru sitting on his
                        throne,
                        would watch wrestling bouts and military feats of his disciples performed in the open arena
                        opposite to
                        the Akal Takhat. As all intricate cases and disputes were finally decided here by the Guru, the
                        Akal
                        Takhat served the purpose of a Supreme Court for the Sikhs. Besides throne, the Guru adopted all
                        other
                        emblems of royalty- the umbrella, the swords, the crest and the hawk, and thus the Sikhs called
                        him a
                        true king or 'Sacha Padshah'- a king in all appearance but in deeds and in purity as holy and
                        great as
                        previous Gurus. People looked towards Akal Takhat for guidance in their secular affairs. This
                        custom
                        became so significant that the decision once taken at Akal Takhat was followed by the Sikhs
                        enthusiastically and this was the reason that they were always able to overcome every peril. The
                        development of this custom contributed a lot towards the consolidation of the Sikh Movement.</p>
                    <p>Some writers charge that lure of politics and glamour of arms led the Guru away from the true
                        path of a
                        religious and spiritual leader. Their judgement is altogether unfounded. There was no political
                        motive
                        of Guru Har Gobind and there is nothing else to substantiate this allegation. Secondly his daily
                        routine
                        was to go to Hari Mandar, listen Asa di Var and then give religious instructions to his
                        followers. He
                        took keen interest in propagation of his religion and appointed preachers in the various regions
                        of the
                        country. He himself undertook tours to various places in Punjab to propagate his faith. However
                        the
                        policy of the Guru symbolized in itself the response to the challenge of the time. Bhai Gurdas
                        justifies
                        the Guru's change in the policy under peculiar circumstances:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just as one has to tie pail's neck while taking out water, Just as to get 'Mani', snake is
                        to be
                        killed;</p>
                    <p>Just as to get Kasturi from deer's neck, deer is to be killed;</p>
                    <p>Just as to get oil, oil seeds are to be crushed;</p>
                    <p>To get kernel, pomegranate is to be broken;</p>
                    <p>Similarly to correct senseless people, sword has to be taken up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>(Bhai Gurdas, Var-34, pauri 13)</p>
                    <p>Guru Har Gobind appears to have been the first Guru Who systematically turned his attention to
                        the chase.
                        His daily routine at Amritsar was:- He rose before day-break, bathed, dressed in full armor, and
                        then
                        went to Hari Mandar to worship. There he heard Japji and Asa di Var being recited. He then
                        preached to
                        his Sikhs. After the concluding prayer, breakfast was served indiscriminately to the Guru's
                        troops and
                        followers as they sat in rows for the purpose. He would rest for some time and then would go to
                        the
                        chase, accompanied by an army of forest beaters, hounds, tamed leopards and hawks of every
                        variety. Late
                        in the afternoon he sat on his throne and give audience to his visitors and followers. Minstrels
                        sang
                        the Guru's hymns and at twilight the 'Sodar' was read. At the conclusion of the service musical
                        instruments of many sorts were played. At the end all adjourned for their evening repast. A
                        sacred
                        concert was afterwards held in which hymns were sung. Next followed the minstrel Abdulla's
                        martial songs
                        to inspire the Sikhs with love of heroic deeds and dispel feelings unworthy of warriors. The
                        Sohila was
                        then read after which the Guru retired to his private apartment.</p>

                                    This annoyed Emperor Jehangir who ordered incarceration of the Guru in the Gwalior
                                    Fort.
                                    Soon realising his mistake, the Emperor ordered his release but the Guru refused to
                                    accept
                                    the offer till 52 innocent 'Rajas' were also freed. Instructions were issued that

                                    to it. Each Raja held one string and walked into freedom. </p></td>

                    <p>Chandu was fearful that the Guru might avenge his father. His daughter was still unmarried and he
                        wrote
                        to the Guru for her alliance which was again refused. He, therefore, once again represented to
                        Emperor
                        Jahangir against the Guru. Upon this Jahangir summoned the Guru to Delhi through Wazir Khan.
                        After
                        careful consideration the Guru agreed to go to Delhi and assigned the secular duties of the Hari
                        Mandar
                        to Bhai Buddha and its spiritual duties to Bhai Gurdas. He instructed,&quot;The Har Mandar is
                        specially
                        devoted to God's service, wherefore it should ever be respected. It should never be defiled with
                        any
                        impurity of the human body. No gambling, wine-drinking, light behavior with women, or slander,
                        should be
                        allowed therein. No one should steal, utter a falsehood, smoke tobacco, or contrive litigation
                        in its
                        precincts. Sikhs, holy men, guests, strangers, the poor and the friendless should ever receive
                        hospitality from Sikhs. My people should ever be humble, repeat God's Name, promote their faith,
                        meditate on Guru's words, and keep all his commandments.&quot; The Guru then went to Delhi.
                        Through the
                        good offices of Wazir Khan, the Emperor received the Guru with great apparent respect. Seeing
                        him very
                        young and already installed as Guru, the Emperor had a good deal of spiritual discussion in
                        order to
                        test his knowledge of divinity.</p>
                    <p>The Emperor having heard that the Guru loved the chase requested him to accompany him one day on
                        a
                        hunting excursion. In the forest a tiger rushed towards the Emperor. Elephants and horses took
                        fright,
                        bullets and arrows were discharged towards the tiger but in vain. The Emperor was completely
                        paralysed
                        with fear and called upon the Guru to save him who alighted from his horse, and taking his sword
                        and
                        shield ran between the tiger and the Emperor. As the tiger sprang, he dealt him a blow with his
                        sword
                        and the tiger fell lifeless on the ground. The Emperor thanked his God that he was saved by the
                        Guru
                        through his heroic endeavor.</p>
                    <p>It was time for the Emperor to visit Agra and he invited the Guru to accompany him. He, after
                        repeated
                        invitations, consented to go. When they both arrived in Agra, the Guru was received with great
                        rejoicing
                        by the people. Seeing increasing friendship between the Emperor and the Guru, Chandu said to
                        himself,&quot;The
                        Guru will take revenge on me whenever he finds an opportunity. I shall only be safe if by some
                        means I
                        succeed in having broken this friendship or having him imprisoned, and thus I should apply all
                        efforts
                        to that end.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Emperor fell ill and he sent for his astrologer to check upon his stars and find the remedy.
                        Chandu
                        took advantage of the situation and bribed the astrologer heavily to sever connection between
                        the Guru
                        and theEmperor. The astrologer accordingly suggested that a holy man of God should go to the
                        Fort of
                        Gwalior and</p>
                    <p>pray for the Emperor's recovery there. Chandu on the other hand advised the Emperor that Guru
                        HarGobind
                        was the holiest of men and thus played double role. Jahangir requested the Guru to go to
                        Gwalior, the
                        latter accepted it without hesitation as another mission awaited him there.</p>
                    <p>There was joy in the Fort when it was known that the Guru was coming. There were fifty-two
                        Indianprinces
                        (Rajas) imprisoned in the Gwalior Fort who were spending their days in lamentation and misery.
                        They
                        believed that they would be released by the Guru's intercession. Hari Das, the governor of the
                        Fort, was
                        happy too, since he had been longing to have 'darshan' (holy sight). He went forth to receive
                        the Guru
                        and prostrated before the Master. The Guru met the princes, comforted them and gave them peace,
                        making
                        them happy even in adversity.</p>
                    <p>Chandu wrote couple of letters to the governor of the Fort, urging him to poison the Guru and put
                        an end
                        to him. Hari Das, however, put all letters before the Guru as he received them; since he had
                        become his
                        devotee. The Guru recited the following Sabad at that time:</p>
                    <p>&quot;The slanderer shall crumble down</p>
                    <p>Like a wall of Kallar; hear, ye brethren, thus shall be known.</p>
                    <p>The slanderer is glad when he seeth a fault; on seeing anything good he is filled with grief.</p>
                    <p>He meditateth evil all day long, but it befalleth not; the evil-minded man dieth meditating
                        evil.</p>
                    <p>The slanderer forgetteth God, and when death approacheth, quarrelleth with God's saint.</p>
                    <p>The Lord Himself preserveth Nanak, what can wretched man do?&quot;</p>
                    <p>(Bilawal Mohalla 5, p-823)</p>
                    <p>Jahangir recovered from illness. The Guru was still in the Gwalior Fort. When the Emperor heard
                        Wazir
                        Khan's pleading on behalf of the Guru (some say, also the pleading of Mian Mir), he ordered that
                        the
                        Guru should be presented to him. On hearing this the imprisoned Rajas were very much distressed.
                        The
                        Master would not leave the Fort unless all the Rajas were also released. The Emperor conceded to
                        his
                        wish and released all the fifty-two princes. From this the Guru is still remembered in Gwalior
                        as Bandi
                        Chhor- the Great Deliverer, the holy man who freed the prisoners. There still stands a shrine
                        'Bandi
                        Chhor' in the historic Fort of Gwalior.</p>
                    <p>Mian Mir brought home to the Emperor the innocence of Guru Arjan and how under his cruel orders,
                        the
                        great divine Master had been tortured to death. The Emperor, however, washed his hands clean of
                        this sin
                        and held Chandu entirely responsible for this crime, who was then arrested by the Emperor's
                        order and
                        taken to Lahore to be executed there. He was paraded through the streets of Lahore, people threw
                        filth
                        on him, and cursed him. A grain-parcher struck him on the head with an iron ladle and Chandu
                        died. When
                        the Emperor heard Chandu's death, he remarked that he richly deserved this fate. The Guru,
                        however,
                        prayed that as Chandu had suffered torment for his sins in this life, God would pardon him
                        hereafter.</p>
                    <p>Sujan, a Masand from Kabul who had amassed great wealth from tithes and offerings, heard that
                        Guru Har
                        Gobind had great love for the horses. He looked far and near and ultimately found a horse of
                        rare beauty
                        and speed which he purchased for a lakh of rupees to make an offering to the Guru. When Sujan
                        was
                        crossing the river Indus, the eye of an officer fell on the horse which was of a rare strain and
                        beauty
                        and he ultimately took away the horse saying that the animal should go to the Emperor. Sujan
                        told the
                        Guru how he was robbed of the horse. The Guru recommended patience and predicted that nobody but
                        himself
                        (Guru) would ride that horse.</p>
                    <p>When the Emperor desired to mount, the horse shook its head which was considered a bad omen.
                        After
                        sometimes the horse fell ill and would neither eat nor drink. All known medicines were tried but
                        in
                        vain. When the horse was on the verge of death, the head Qazi (Rustam Khan) suggested that if
                        the holy
                        Quran was read for him, he might recover. Upon this the horse was presented to the Qazi.</p>
                    <p>When the Qazi was leading the horse home, the animal neighed as it passed through the Guru's tent
                        (Guru
                        was at Lahore at that time). Through negotiations with the Qazi, the horse was purchased for ten
                        thousand rupees. The Guru patted on the neck of the horse and it started recovering its
                        strength.</p>
