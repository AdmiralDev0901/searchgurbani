        <p align="left"><strong><a name="1" id="1">RAJA BHIM CHAND AND THE GURU</a></strong></p>
        <p>Raja Bhim Chand was received in Guru's darbar (court) with great honor. He prayed to the Guru to let him see
            the
            gifts from the Raja of Assam. He was shown all the presents. Bhim Chand was astonished at the magnificence
            of the
            Kabuli tent. He was told that it was the offering of a pious Sikh from Kabul. During this conversation when
            the
            beautifully decorated elephant was let forward, Bhim Chand stood spellbound and expressed his unbounded
            admiration
            of all that he had seen. On his homeward journey his mind burned with jealousy of the Guru's state and
            wealth and he
            made up his mind to take possession of at least the elephant.</p>

        <p>On his return to the capital, Bhim Chand disclosed his designs to his courtiers . It was decided that a
            messageshould
            be sent to the Guru that Raja Fateh Chand of Garhwal's party was coming with the object of Betrothing his
            daughter
            to Bhim Chand's son, and Bhim Chand desired to borrow the elephant so as to makea display of his wealth to
            his
            guests. When the message was delivered to the Guru, he knew that it was only a trick to obtain permanent
            possession
            of the animal. He sent the reply to Bhim Chand,&quot; The Raja who presented the elephant, requested me not
            to let
            the animal go out of my possession. It is the principle of Guru's house to comply with such requests.&quot;
            It is
            said that the Raja sent his emissaries thrice, the last one being Kesari Chand, the Raja of Jaswal, but the
            Guru did
            not yield and therefore, Bhim Chand's demand was not met. So he got angry and wanted to take revenge.</p>
        <p>Majority of the ma sands felt agitated at the Guru's warlike preparations and they represented to his
            motherto
            dissuade him from such activities lest it should bring some trouble to him. When his mother talked to him
            about it,
            he replied,&quot; Dear mother, I have been sent by the Immortal God. He who worshippeth Him shall be happy;
            but he
            who acteth dishonestly and worshippeth stones shall receive well-merited retribution. This is my commission
            from
            God. If today I give Raja Bhim Chand the elephant, I shall have to pay him tribute tomorrow.&quot; Nand
            Chand then
            joined the conversation and said,&quot; Mother, hath a lion ever feared jackals? Hath any one ever seen the
            light of
            the firefly in bright sunshine? What availeth a drop of water in comparison with the ocean? The Guru is a
            tiger
            brave and splendid as the sun. Shall he fear Bhim Chand?&quot; The Master ended the discussion by saying,&quot;Dear
            mother, heed not the evil advice of the masands. They have become cowards by eating the offerings of the
            Sikhs.&quot;
            The Guru and his troops continued to practise archery and devoted themselves to the chase. The Sikhs kept
            visiting
            continually and make offering of arms. Those who came for military service, were readily received and were
            taught
            the profession of arms. In this way the Guru collected a considerable army.</p>

        <p>In the meantime the Raja Medani Parkash of Nahan, invited the Guru to visit him. The invitation was accepted
            and he
            left for Nahan. Gulab Rai and Sham Das were made incharge for the defence of Anandpur. The Raja came to
            greet and
            welcome the Guru and then took him to his palace. One day the Raja took him on hunting excursion and
            complained that
            Raja Fateh Shah of Garhwal had often quarrelled with him over the ground on which they were then standing.
            He
            suggested that he would be very pleased if a fort were to be constructed on the spot for protection against
            the
            enemy. The Guru erected a tent on that spot and held a darbar. He laid down foundation stone of the fort.
            With the
            help of the Raja's army and with the zeal and energy of the workmen, the fort was completed within a short
            time. The
            Guru named it Paunta, and started to live there and continued to increase his army.</p>
        <p>Raja F ateh Shah of Garhwal arrived at the conclusion that since the Guru started living near his territory,
            itwould,
            therefore, be politic to be on good terms with him and accordingly he decided to pay a visit to the Guru. He
            was
            received with great honor in the Guru's darbar (court). During his visit the Guru sent his uncle Kirpal to
            him to
            suggest that it would be well if he and the Raja of Nahan were on good terms. Raja Fateh Shah gave his
            consent
            immediately. The Guru then sent for the Raja of Nahan. He brought the two Rajas together in the open court,
            caused
            them to embrace and form a friendship.</p>
        <p>In the meantime a hillman came with tidings of a fierce tiger which was destroying cattle in the
            neighborhood. He
            requested the Guru to free the country from the wild animal. He took the two Rajas and others to the place
            where the
            tiger was said to be residing. On hearing the huntsmen's foot steps, the tiger sat on his haunches looking
            at his
            pursuers. The Guru called on any one who could engage the tiger with sword and shield. No one came forward.
            He then
            took his sword and shield and challenged the tiger. The tiger rose with a roar and sprang at the Guru, who
            received
            him on his shield and striking him on the flank with his sword, cut him in two. The Rajas and the hunting
            party were
            astonished and delighted at his strength and bravery.</p>

        <p>Ram Rai, the eldest son of Guru Har Rai, when sent to Delhi on behalf of the Guru, distorted the holy words
            of Guru
            Nanak in the court of Aurangzeb in order to please the Emperor. Upon this the Guru disowned him and
            communicated him
            from the Sikh faith. The Emperor gave him an estate where he founded the town of Dehra Dun and continued to
            live
            there. Ram Rai claimed himself as the real Guru. Being a willing tool in the hands of the Mughal Emperor, he
            continually tried to harm the cause of the Sikhs. Now since Guru Gobind Singh had come to Paunta, which was
            only
            thirty miles from Dehra Dun, Ram Rai became afraid of him and could not muster courage to face him. A
            discussion
            started in Ram Rai's assembly about all this. Hearing on Ram Rai's anxiety, the Guru sent Nand Chand and
            Daya Ram to
            reassure him that no harm would be done to him. Ram Rai on receiving the Guru's message, was very much
            delighted. He
            gave robes of honor to Nand Chand and Daya Ram and decided to be on friendly terms with the Guru.</p>
        <p>It is said that a meeting between the Guru and Ram Rai took place in a ferry in the middle of the stream. Ram
            Rai
            touched the Guru's feet in obeisance and said,&quot; I am fortunate to have obtained a sight of thee. When I
            am
            gone, protect my family........my father Guru Har Rai used to say that someone would be born from our family
            who
            would restore and refit the vessel for the safe conveyance of the souls.&quot; He asked for forgiveness. Ram
            Rai
            while he was in trance, was cremated by his masands in defiance of the entreaties and prayers of his wife,
            Punjab
            Kaur. The Guru then responded to the request of Punjab Kaur and meted out strict punishment to the guilty
            masands
            and rewarded those who had remained faithful to her.</p>

        <p><strong><a name="4" id="4">PIR BUDHU SHAH:</a></strong></p>
        <p>Pir Budhu Shah was a Muslim saint who lived at Sadhaura, about ten or fifteen miles from Paunta Sahib. He was
            well
            known for his piety and had a large number of followers. He had heard of Guru Nanak and his mission. He had
            also
            learned that Guru Nanak's throne was then occupied by Guru Gobind Singh who was staying in the neighborhood.
            Ultimately he decided to visit him. The Guru seated the Pir near him who beseeched,&quot; Pray! tell us how
            one
            meets God Almighty.&quot; During the discussion the Pir humbly submitted to the Master. There was a glow in
            the eyes
            of the Guru which radiated Divine Light and the Pir exclaimed with sudden joy,&quot; Allah-hu- Akbar!&quot;
            - Great
            is God Almighty. After a while the Pir confessed,&quot; Master, I was spiritually blind and you have shown
            me the
            Light.&quot; Blessed are the souls on whom the Guru bestows the divine grace.</p>
