        <p><a name="ANIMOSITY" id="ANIMOSITY">ANIMOSITY OF PRITHI CHAND:</a></p>
        <p>As referred to in the previous chapter, Prithi Chand was superseded and the Guruship was conferred on his
            youngest
            brother by his father, Guru Ram Das. Upon this Prithi Chand adopted an attitude of open defiance. He met
            Sulhi Khan,
            a revenue officer of Lahore province and told him that he was filing a complaint to the Emperor against his
            youngest
            brother for superseding him. Next he conspired with the headmen of the area who then told Guru Arjan that
            being the
            eldest son, Prithia had the right to the property of his father. The Guru gave the property to Prithia and
            some of
            it to Mahadev, the other brother, and reserved the voluntary offerings of the Sikhs for himself.</p>
        <p>Prithi Chand in alliance with Sulhi Khan found ample opportunities to harass the Guru. However Wazir Khan,
            Akbar's
            assistant prime minister, interposed on behalf of the Guru and prevailed on Sulhi Khan to bring the two
            brothers to
            a compromise. By listening to Guru's Sukhmani (The song of Eternal peace compiled by Guru Arjan), Wazir Khan
            was
            restored to perfect health from dropsy ailment. This was the reason why Wazir Khan supported the Guru's
            cause.
            Although the compromise had been affected, yet Prithia continued to create every possible trouble for the
            Guru.
            Ultimately the urdu decided to leave Amritsar and make a tour of Majha, an area between the rivers Ravi and
            Beas.</p>

                    Arjan knew the plight of the lepers. Even their close relatives would not touch them. Guru Arjan
                    took
                    special care of the lepers and got constructed a Leper Home near the sacred Sarovar of Taran Taaran
                    Sahib.
                    Guru Sahib personally looked after the lepers by providing them medicines, dresses and even
                    showering his
                    blessings on them. All the Sikhs followed the example of the Guru - Bhagat Puran Singh was a living
                    example
                    of that.

        <p>The Guru first visited Khadur and then proceeded to Sarhauli where he sought to obtain land to build a
            dwelling for
            himself.</p>
        <p>A Sikh from the village Bhaini invited the Guru to visit him. When he arrived there, it was late at night.
            The wife
            of the Sikh prepared a dish of broken bread with butter and sugar and laid it before the Guru. He enjoyed
            the dish
            prepared with love and devotion. He stayed there a few more days and in return he gave the village his own
            Chola and
            renamed the village as Chola Sahib.</p>
        <p>The Guru then visited village Khanpur, situated between Goindwal and the present city of Tarn Taran. He was
            accompanied by five Sikhs including Bidhi Chand and Bhai Gurdas. It was a cold night and wintry winds were
            blowing
            hard. Bidhi Chand saw a lofty building and requested the Guru to go to that building, but the Guru objected
            saying
            that it would be better to stay where they were rather than to go to a place where evil people were
            dwelling. Bidhi
            Chand did not agree with the Guru and went to the lofty building and asked the owners for shelter, which
            they
            refused and called the Guru and his Sikhs hypocrites. Hema, a devout Sikh of that village, came and
            requested the
            Guru to visit his poor dwelling and bless it with his holy presence. Seeing his love and devotion, the Guru
            accepted
            his hospitality. Hema cooked and supplied his best food for the party. He took his sole blanket and put it
            under the
            Guru as bedding, who seeing Hema's devotion uttered the following Sabad:</p>
        <p>&quot;Very beautiful is the hut in which God's praises are sung, While the mansion in which God is forgotten
            is of no
            avail. There is a pleasure even in poverty when in the company of saints God is remembered, May that
            grandeur which
            is bound up with mammon, perish! Blessed is turning a handmill or wearing a coarse blanket, if the heart is
            happy
            and contented. That empire is of no avail which conferreth not satisfaction, Those who wander even naked in
            the love
            of one God obtain honor.</p>
        <p><em>Vain are silks and satins, attachment to which maketh man covetous.</em></p>
        <p><em>Everything is in Thy power, O God; Thou actest and causest to act.</em></p>
        <p><em>May Nanak obtain the gift of remembering Thee at every breath.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><em>(Rag Suhi Mohalla 5, p-745</em>)</p>
        <p>The Guru stayed there for some time. During his stay, Hema obtained his desire and went to his final rest.
            After
            Guru's departure, the Emperor's viceroy, who for some reason became dissatisfied with the inhabitants of
            Khanpur,
            sent his army and razed the village to the ground and massacred its chief residents. From there he proceeded
            to the
            village of Khaira where he was attracted by the natural environments. He had a very warm welcome from the
            headmen.
            They afterwards assisted him in obtaining land from the villagers on which he laid down the foundation of
            what is
            now the famous city of Tarn Taran; and he proceeded to construct a tank there. This happened in 1590. The
            Guru, at a
            great expense, built brick-kiln for baking the bricks. The local officer named Nur-ud-din seized the bricks
            for the
            construction of a Sarai that was being built at Government expense. The Sikhs resented and requested the
            Guru to
            write to the Emperor against this high- handedness of Nur-ud-din, but the Guru refused to take notice of the
            outrage. He left quietly and waited for better times for the completion of the project. After sometimes the
            tank was
            completed.</p>
        <p>The Guru then crossed the river Beas and proceeded to Jullundhur area where he purchased land to build city
            to be
            named as Kartarpur (city of Creator). He with his own hands cut the first sod for the construction of the
            city and a
            well to supply water to the inhabitants. The well was called Gangsar.</p>
        <p>He went to Nakka at the invitation of his devotees. He visited Khemkaran, Chunian and other villages. Then he
            reached
            Jambar and remained there for some time. He made many converts in that area.</p>
        <p>At the invitation of his Sikhs, the Guru went to Lahore. People of all classes flocked to see him. Jogi
            Shambhunath,
            Shah Husain, Shah Suleman and others came to see the Guru beseeching soul-saving religious instruction. The
            Guru
            uttered the following Sabad on that occasion:</p>
        <p><em>&quot;O wise men, think of the Lord in your hearts,</em></p>
        <p><em>The true King, the Releaser from bondage, dwelleth in the hearts by the mind's affection.</em></p>
        <p><em>Nothing is equal in value to the sight of God.</em></p>
        <p><em>Thou art the pure Cherisher;</em></p>
        <p><em>Thou art the Lord great and Incomparable.</em></p>
        <p><em>Give me Thy hand, O Brave One, Thou art the only one to assist me.</em></p>
        <p><em>Creator, by Thy power, didst</em></p>
        <p><em>Thou create the world; Thou art Nanak's prop.&quot;</em></p>

        <p>This Sabad, when heard by the Viceroy of Lahore, produced a profound impression on his mind. He asked the
            Guru if he
            could render any service to him. Upon his consent, the viceroy got a Bawli excavated.</p>
        <p>From there he went to the shrine of Guru Nanak at Dera Baba Nanak. After that he proceeded to Barath to visit
            Sri
            Chand, Guru Nanak's son.</p>
        <p>The Guru returned to Amritsar but Prithia still continued to create problems for him. Prithia's wife was very
            much
            sore and complained,&quot;The eldest son has been superseded. The youngest one obtained the Guruship and the
            whole
            world, both Emperor and the common man, worships him.&quot; Prithia replied,&quot;Arjan has no son and so
            his
            prosperity is short-lived. Our son Meharban will be the next Guru.&quot; Guru's wife heard this conversation
            and
            reported it to the Guru, and prayed that he should grant her a son. He bade her to pay no heed to the
            remarks of
            Prithia or his wife but should continue to repeat true Name. One day again she requested the Guru,&quot;O
            King, they
            who seek thy protection, obtain happiness in this life and salvation in the next. My married life would be
            most
            happy if you grant me a son.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Guru always blessed his Sikhs and then most of the religious acts were performed through them. When his
            wife
            continued pressing for the gift of a son, he told her to go to his revered Sikh, Bhai Buddha and pray for
            the
            desired gift. Next day the Guru's wife set out in great state to see Bhai Buddha. She took her attendants
            and the
            wives of the headmen of Amritsar and rode in carriages with great pomp and show. She carried plates of
            sweets as
            offering to the saint. When Bhai Buddha saw the procession he remarked,&quot;What happened! Is there a
            stampede from
            Amritsar that the inhabitants have left the city and are coming here?&quot; She placed plates of sweets
            before Bhai
            Buddha and prayed for his blessing. Bhai Buddha replied,&quot;Respected lady, I am only a servant of your
            house. It
            is only the Guru who is an ocean of supernatural power, who fulfills every one's desires. I am also not
            worthy of
            these savoury dishes. Were I to eat them, how could I, afterwards, think of cutting the grass?&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">So she came back very much disappointed and related the whole story to the Guru, who then remarked,&quot;The
            saints
            and the true Guru are not pleased with display of pomp. If you desire anything from them, appear before them
            not in
            a state of superiority but in a humble manner. If you still desire the saint's blessing, then with devotion
            in thy
            heart, prepare bread with your hands, dress yourself like an ordinary person and go alone on foot.&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">As instructed by the Guru, she proceeded all alone next day. On seeing her Bhai Buddha said,&quot;Hail O
            lady! Give
            me what you have brought.&quot; While eating he said,&quot;The Guru is the owner of the storehouse, but I
            have
            received instructions to open it. As you have given me food of my heart's content, so shall you have a son
            of thy
            heart's content.&quot; On her return she told the Guru about the graciousness of Bhai Buddha.</p>
        <p class="black">When Prithias learnt the news of Guru's wife's pregnancy, they got very upset and instigated Sulhi Khan
            against the
            Guru. To avoid conflict, the Guru moved to village Wadali, about six to seven miles away from Amritsar.</p>
        <p class="black">On 19th of June, 1595 (21st of the month of Har, Sambat 1652), Guru's wife gave birth to a son named Har
            Gobind at
            Wadali. On the birth of his son, the Guru uttered the following Sabad:</p>
        <p><em>&quot;The True Guru sent me a son;</em></p>
        <p><em>A long-lived son hath been born by destiny.</em></p>
        <p><em>When he took his dwelling in the womb,</em></p>
        <p><em>His mother's heart was exceedingly glad.</em></p>
        <p><em>The destiny recorded in the beginning hath become manifest to all.</em></p>
        <p><em>By God's order the boy hath been born in the tenth month.</em></p>

        <p class="black">On hearing the birth of Har Gobind, Prithias were very much saddened. They immediately began to hatch
            conspiracies to
            put an end to the life of the infant Har Gobind. Several attempts were made to this effect. Prithia hired a
            nurse to
            poison the baby. She applied poison to nipples of her breast and went to Wadali. In the meantime the child
            was said
            to have stopped breast suckling due to some indisposition. The nurse first congratulated the Guru's wife on
            the
            birth of the child. She then caressed and fondled the baby trying to breast feed him. The child refused
            suckling. At
            that time, for some mysterious reasons, nurse fainted and fell backwards. When she regained her
            consciousness, she
            repented and disclosed that Prithia had hired her to kill the infant. The story of Prithia's ill scheme
            spread from
            house to house.</p>
        <p class="black">Prithia then hired a snake-charmer and induced him to kill the child by exposing him to a cobra. He promised
            the
            snake-charmer a great sum of money if he succeeded in the plot. The snake-charmer found a chance and let a
            black
            cobra loose in the court-yard. It is said that Har Gobind took the hissing cobra in his hand and killed it
            immediately.</p>
        <p class="black">Sikhs from distant places visited Amritsar during the absence of the Guru. Prithia made efforts to convince
            them that
            he was the real Guru but could not succeed in his mission. When Har Gobind was two years old, some prominent
            Sikhs
            came to Wadali and requested the Guru to return to Amritsar which he did. Har Gobind became ill with
            small-pox of
            very virulent type. The people suggested to the Guru to make offerings to the goddess of small-pox but he
            rejected
            their advice to worship the goddess for the recovery of his son's illness. He, rather, stressed the worship
            of only
            one God who is the Creator and the sole Cherisher. The Guru uttered many Sabads in Rag Bilawal and Sorath on
            this
            subject. By the grace of God, Har Gobind recovered fully in a few days.</p>
        <p class="black">Prithia took another shot and induced Har Gobind's male nurse to poison the child. Next day the servant
            slipped
            poison in the baby's milk. The child, however, turned away from the poisoned milk and refused to drink it.
            The
            servant tried to fondle Har Gobind in feeding the contaminated milk but in vain. When the baby started
            crying, the
            Guru inquired of the cause of his weeping. The servant replied that he did not drink the milk and when he
            pressed
            him to drink, he began to cry. Then the Guru, himself tried to feed the baby who insisted on refusing to
            drink. Upon
            this the Guru took a sample of that milk and fed it to a dog which fell immediately sick and died. The
            servant
            realized his ill doings and confessed to the Guru and disclosed the murderous designs of Prithia.</p>
        <p class="black">Prithia became very furious and went to Delhi with Sulhi Khan to complain against the Guru to the Emperor.
            Before his
            departure to Delhi, Guru's other brother, Mahadev and Bhai Gurdas tried to restrain Prithia but he would not
            listen.
            Sulhi Khan presented the complaint to the Emperor who decided not to interfere in the affairs of religious
            men and
            secondly he concluded that the charges were not true. Prithia was crushed by his disappointment.</p>
        <p class="black">When Har Gobind became of a suitable age to receive instructions, he was entrusted to Bhai Buddha for his
            education.
            Bhai Buddha gave him adequate lessons and also taught him the use of offensive and defensive weapons,
            riding,
            chemistry, astronomy, medicine, agriculture, administration and other sciences. The Guru offered
            acknowledgement to
            Bhai Buddha for his successful and comprehensive instructions.</p>
