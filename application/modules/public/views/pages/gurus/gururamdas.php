                                <p>&nbsp;The early history of Guru Ram Das is referred to in the previous chapter. Many
                                    writers
                                    have expressed their opinion that Akbar granted the land only to Guru Ram Das on
                                    which he
                                    founded the city of Ramdaspur (later known as Amritsar), and so they contend that
                                    the city
                                    of Amritsar was not founded during the time of Guru Amar Das. It is also a
                                    well-known fact
                                    of Sikh history that Emperor Akbar came to Goindwal and he dined with the common
                                    people in
                                    the Guru's langar before he could see the Guru. It seems that the Emperor granted
                                    the estate
                                    in the name of Bibi Bhani at that time, and Jethaji being her husband, was made
                                    incharge of
                                    the estate by Guru Amar Das. Guru Nanak awarded the Guruship to Bhai Lehna and not
                                    to his
                                    sons, and it is quite obvious that in order to avoid hostility of his sons towards
                                    his
                                    successor, he asked Guru Angad to move to Khadur instead of continuing to live in
                                    Kartarpur.
                                    The same circumstances prevailed during the reign of second and third Gurus. It is,
                                    therefore, quite likely that the planning of a new city was called for during the
                                    reign of
                                    Guru Amar Das as mentioned in the previous part.</p>

                                    said that it were their parents who had provided them with food and other

                                <p>One day a crippled leper came to the town and the father married his fifth daughter
                                    to him to
                                    teach her a lesson. She willfully accepted him as her true husband. She put him in a

                                    and carried him on her head, and begged from door to door to maintain their
                                    livelihood. One
                                    day she left him under a tree near a pool of water and went to the nearby colony to
                                    beg for
                                    food. The leper saw some crows (black in color) dipping in the water and they turned
                                    white
                                    when came out of the water. The leper thought that the water had some miraculous

                                    property. So he left his basket and crawled into the water, and lo, the leprosy at

                                    disappeared from the body except one finger which was left out of water. When the

                                    back, she did not believe the story of the healed leper. Ultimately they went to

                                    Das, who confirmed saying that the pool possesseth such extraordinary efficacy which

                                    came to

                                    is said that he was incharge of the offerings that were made to the Guru and was

                                    might have fallen in somebody else's hands. Secondly he thought that the time was
                                    fast
                                    approaching for the selection of a person to succeed his father as Guru and so he
                                    should
                                    remain in Amritsar. Mahadev, the Guru's second son, did not want to go because of
                                    his
                                    indifference to worldly affairs. The third son, Arjan Dev agreed to attend the
                                    marriage. He
                                    was instructed to stay on in Lahore after the marriage to look after the affairs of
                                    the Sikh
                                    Sangat of that place.</p>
                                <p>After some time he started feeling the pangs of separation for his father and the
                                    Guru, and
                                    wrote three letters, two of which were intercepted by his elder brother, Prithi
                                    Chand. A
                                    letter marked '3', reached the Guru and Arjan Dev was immediately recalled from
                                    Lahore. On
                                    his return he told his father that he had sent three letters. The truth came to
                                    light and
                                    Prithi Chand was forced to produce the other two letters. Thus Prithi Chand's
                                    actions were
                                    exposed.</p>
                                <p>Guru Ram Das embraced Arjan Dev, sent for five paise and a coco-nut, and placed them
                                    before
                                    him. He descending from his throne, seated him there before the whole assembly of
                                    the Sikhs.
                                    Bhai Buddha affixed the tilak of spiritual sovereignty to Arjan Dev's forehead, and
                                    thus he
                                    was proclaimed as Guru Arjan Dev. This appened in August, 1581.</p>
                                <p>Prithi Chand became so mad that he addressed his father in abusive language. He told
                                    Bhai
                                    Buddha that his father acted improperly in giving Guruship to his younger brother.
                                    He vowed
                                    that he would remove Guru Arjan and would seat himself on the Guru Gaddi (throne).
                                    The Guru
                                    counselled him not to quarrel about it, but Prithi Chand refused to submit and
                                    adopted an
                                    attitude of open defiance.</p>
                                <p>Having nominated Guru Arjan Dev, Guru Ram Das left for his old headquarters at
                                    Goindwal.
                                    After a few days He left eft this world on the first of September, 1581.</p></td>
