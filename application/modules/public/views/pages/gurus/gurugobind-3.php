        <p><strong><a name="1" id="1">THE BATTLE OF BHANGANI:</a></strong></p>
        <p class="black">One day the Guru received an invitation from Fateh Shah of Garhwal to his daughter's marriage with the son of
            Raja
            Bhim Chand of Kahlur who nursed enmity with the Guru. He decided not to attend the ceremony himself but sent
            his
            Dewan, Nand Chand and Daya Ram with costly gifts for the princess.</p>

        <p>The shortest route for the marriage party was through Paunta Sahib; the Guru refused to give them the passage
            because
            he had no faith in Bhim Chand who was accompanied by a large number of soldiers. After a lot of
            negotiations, the
            Guru permitted the bridegroom and a small number of his companions to cross the ferry near Paunta Sahib. The
            rest of
            the party including Bhim Chand had to follow a circuitous route to Srinagar, the capital of Garhwal state.
            This
            happening made Bhim Chand very mad and he began to look forward to the opportunity to give vent to his
            anger. He
            became still more enraged when he learnt that Guru's envoy was present at the bride's place to attend the
            marriage.
            Thus he refused to accept Fateh Shah's daughter for his son, if he continued his friendship with the Guru.
            Bhim
            Chand, therefore, asked Fateh Shah to choose between himself and the Guru. Fateh Shah was obliged to yield.
            Nand
            Chand and Daya Ram had to bring their presents back as a result. On their way back Nand Chand and party were
            attacked by Bhim Chand's troops but they were able to return safe and sound. After the marriage was over,
            Bhim Chand
            held a conference with Fateh Shah and other hilly Rajas- Kirpal of Katoch, Gopal of Guler, Hari Chand of
            Hadur and
            the Raja of Jaswal who were present there. They all decided to attack the Guru on their way back.</p>
        <p>The hilly Rajas ordered their troops to march upon Paunta Sahib. The news of the impending attack came fast
            before
            the army could move and so the Guru was not taken by surprise attack.</p>
        <p class="black">On the recommendation of Pir Budhu Shah, 500 Pathans were enlisted in the Guru's army under the command of
            five
            chieftains- Kale Khan, Bhikan Khan, Nijabat Khan, Hyat Khan, and Umar Khan. The Pathans became apprehensive
            of the
            scanty resources at the disposal of the Guru and they all except Kale Khan with one hundred men, deserted
            the Guru
            at the eleventh hour, and joined the hill Rajas. The Udasi Sadhus except their chief Mahant Kirpal, also
            took to
            their heels. The Guru informed Budhu Shah of the misconduct of the Pathan soldiers. Pir Budhu Shah looked
            upon their
            behavior as a personal disgrace. In order to compensate this loss, Budhu Shah accordingly placed himself,
            his
            brother, his four sons and seven hundred disciples at the Guru's disposal.</p>
        <p class="black">The Guru stationed his troops at an eminent place near Bhangani village about six miles from Paunta Sahib.
            The five
            sons of Bibi Viro- Sango Shah, Jit Mal, Gopal Chand, Ganga Ram and Mohri Chand organized the attack for the
            Guru's
            forces. They were ably backed by Bhai Daya Ram, Dewan Nand Chand, Guru's uncle Kirpal and Mahant Kirpal.
            While
            repeating his orders the Guru buckled on his sword, slung his quiver over his shoulders, took his bow in his
            hand,
            mounted his steed, and shouting 'Sat Sri Akal' in his loudest voice, proceeded to confront his enemies. It
            is
            recorded that the hoofs of the Guru's horse in their quick movement raised clouds of dust which obscured the
            sun,
            and that the cheers of his men resembled thunder in the stormy and rainy season. As mentioned Guru's forces
            were
            also joined by Pir Budhu Shah's troops and one hundred Pathans under the command of Kale Khan.</p>

        <p>The enemy forces were led by Raja Fateh Shah who was joined by Raja Hari Chand of Hadur, Raja Gopal of Guler,
            Raja of
            Chandel, Rajas of Dadhwal and Jaswal, and four hundred Pathans who had deserted the Guru's side. A severe
            and bloody
            battle was raged. Many brave soldiers were killed on both sides. Although the opposite army far outnumbered
            the
            Guru's men, but they did not have the same spirit of sacrifice, nor did they have the same devotion to their
            leaders, as the Sikhs had. Mahant Kirpal hit Hayat Khan, Pathan chief, and killed the deserter. Jit Mal and
            Raja
            Hari Chand engaged in a single combat. The arrows lodged in their horses' foreheads and both horses fell.
            After a
            short breath when their swords clashed, Hari Chand fell fainting to the ground and Jit Mal dropped down
            dead. Sango
            Shah, another cousin of the Guru, and Pathan chief Nijabat Khan were engaged and both fell dead. Upon this
            the Guru
            mounted his charger and rode into the thick of the combat. He discharged an arrow at Pathan leader Bhikan
            Khan. It
            missed him but killed his horse, and Bhikan Khan fled away. Upon this Nand Chand and Daya Ram launched a
            fierce
            attack on the demoralized Pathans which resulted in great slaughter of the treacherous Pathans. When the
            hillmen saw
            the defeat of the Pathans, they began fleeing from the battle field. By this time Hari Chand regained his
            conscious
            and reappeared on the scene and shot many brave men with his arrows. On seeing this the Guru confronted Hari
            Chand
            and he describes the combat in Bachitar Natak:</p>
        <p>&quot;Hari Chand, one of the hill chiefs, in his rage drew forth the arrows. He struck my steed with one
            and</p>
        <p>then discharged another at me, but God preserved me and it only grazed my ears in its flight. His third</p>
        <p>Who protected me, His servant. When I felt the touch of the arrow, my spirit was kindled. I took up</p>
        <p>my bow and taking aim killed the young chief Hari Chand with my very first shot. I discharged arrows</p>
        <p>in abundance. Upon this my adversaries began to flee. The chief of Korari was also seized by death.</p>
        <p>Upon this the hill men fled in consternation and I, through the favor of God Almighty, gained the</p>
        <p>victory........&quot; (Translated)</p>
        <p>The Guru went to the site where lay the dead bodies of Sangho Shah, Jit Mal and other brave Sikhs. Two sons
            of Budhu
            Shah were also killed. The Guru ordered the slain on both sides be disposed of with great honor. The bodies
            of the
            Sikhs were cremated, of the Hindus thrown into the river and of the Muslims buried with all solemnity. Pir
            Budhu
            Shah presented himself and his two surviving sons to the Guru. At that time the Guru was combing his hair.
            Budhu
            Shah begged of him to give him the comb with his loose hair as a sacred souvenir. The Guru gave him the
            turban, the
            comb with hair and a small sword. The greatest gift of all, the Guru blessed him with Nam.</p>
        <p>Significance of the battle of Bhangani:</p>
        <p class="black">The victory in the battle of Bhangani was of far reaching importance. It uplifted the spirit and strengthened
            the
            moral of the Sikhs. Since the Guru did not acquire even an inch of the territory or gained any material
            advantage,
            the cause he championed, received added strength. His fame spread far and wide with the result that the
            supply of
            arms and horses to the Guru increased abundantly and hundreds and hundreds of persons offered themselves to
            be
            enlisted in his army. The Guru's victory also did not go without causing concern to the Mughal rule at
            Delhi. The
            hilly Rajas also viewed the whole issue afresh. Although the Rajas and the Guru were poles apart in
            ideology, yet
            the Rajas being goaded by their self-interest of thwarting the Mughals over lordship and thus to be relieved
            of the
            burdens of payment of annual tributes to the Mughal Emperor, wanted cordial relations with the Guru.
            Therefore,
            their leader Raja Bhim Chand entered into agreement with him.</p>

        <p><strong><a name="2" id="2">RETURN TO ANANDPUR:</a></strong></p>
        <p class="black">The Guru remained about three years at Paunta Sahib and his fame attracted poets, singers and learned people
            to his
            court. During this period he composed Jap Sahib, Swayas and Akal Ustat. He ordered his army to return to
            Anandpur
            and he came back via Sadhaura and th en encamped at Laharpurfor a few days. Raja of Nahan sent his envoy to
            convey
            his desire to meet the Guru but he never did. Leaving Nahan the Guru entered Ramgarh state and stayed at
            Tabra for
            more than a week. He then went to Raipur in response to the invitation of the Rani of that place. She showed
            him the
            greatest hospitality and presented him a beautiful horse with costly trappings, and a purse of Rupees as an
            offering. He gave her son a sword and shield. After this he continued his journey to Anandpur and passing
            through
            Toda, Nada, Dhakoli, Kotla, Ghanaula, Bunga, he reached Kiratpur. From there he reached Anandpur in October,
            1687.
            The eldest son, Ajit Singh was born on the fourth day of bright half of Magh, Sambat 1743 (1687 A.D.).</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><a name="3" id="3">EXPEDITION OF ALIF KHAN</a>:</strong></p>
        <p class="black">The south India was up in the arms. Emperor Aurangzeb, therefore, remained busy many years in suppressing the
            revolt
            in southern India. All the expenditure of such a long war was met by levying heavy tribute on the northern
            and
            eastern provinces of the country. At that time Mian Khan was a viceroy of Jammu. He sent his
            commander-in-chief,
            Alif Khan to levy tribute on the hill Rajas. First he addressed Raja Kirpal of Kangra,&quot; Either pay me
            the
            tribute or contend with me in arms.&quot; Raja Kirpal gave him certain presents and then told him that Raja
            Bhim
            Chand of Kahlur was the greatest of all the Rajas. If he pays the tribute first, all the rest will follow
            him. If
            Bhim Chand refused to pay, he (Kirpal) would support him. Raja Dayal of Bijarwal was persuaded by Kirpal to
            meet
            Alif Khan's demands.</p>
        <p class="black">Alif Khan adopted Raja Kirpal's suggestion and proceeded towards the capital of Bhim Chand's state. He halted
            at
            Nadaun and sent his envoy to Bhim Chand with his demands. Bhim Chand replied that he would defend himself
            rather pay
            the tribute. However his prime minister advised Bhim Chand that if he desired victory, it would be assured
            only if
            he had obtained Guru's assistance. Upon this Bhim Chand sent his prime minister to the Guru to seek his
            active
            support. The Guru agreed to support the movement of non- payment of tributes which symbolized the spirit of
            defiance
            against the Mughal imperialism. The Guru came in person as the head of a strong contingent. The Rajas of
            Jaswal,
            Dadhwal and Jasrot also came to participate in the impending war.</p>
        <p class="black">Bhim Chand opened the attack with sharp arrows but the shots could not make any impact on the enemy because
            of their
            position and they struck only the wooden rafters of the fortress. The troops of Bhim Chand began to grow
            indifferent. At this critical juncture the Guru played his part most effectively. He took his gun and aimed
            at Raja
            Dayal. Fighting bravely the Raja fell to the ground. The Guru shot arrows one after the other on the enemy.
            Arrows
            and bullets flew in abundance and the battle turned in their favor. Alif Khan and his men fled and Bhim
            Chand won
            the victory. He remained at Nadaun for sometimes where he reached an understanding with Alif Khan through
            Kirpal who
            acted as intermediary.</p>
        <p class="black">The Guru after staying about a week there, returned to Anandpur. His son, Jujhar Singh was born on the
            seventh day of
            month of Chet, Sambat 1747 (1691 A.D.)</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p><strong><a name="4" id="4">DILAWAR KHAN'S ATTEMPT TO WEAKEN GURU'S POWER:</a></strong></p>
        <p class="black">Dilawar Khan who attained power in Punjab while Aurangzeb was in the Daccan (south), became jealous about
            Guru's fame
            and success. He sent his son Khanzada with a force of one thousand men to curb the power of the Guru at
            Anandpur.
            Khanzada crossed the river Satluj under the cover of the darkness at about midnight when Guru's scout, Alam
            Khan
            hastened to give information to him about the approach of a hostile force. The drum (Ranjit Nigara) was
            immediately
            beaten and Guru's men at once marched to the river. The quick formation of the Sikhs bewildered the enemy
            and the
            guns which began discharging volleys of shots, terrified Khanzada's men so much that they were constrained
            to reel
            back. However they plundered the village of Barwa on their way back. Khanzada through shame, could not
            answer to his
            father when he censored him for his cowardice. This happened at the end of 1694.</p>

        <p>Dilawar Khan had a slave called Hussain who boasted that if he were given a command, he would sack the Guru's
            city of
            Anandpur and exact tribute from Bhim Chand and other hilly Rajas. The failure of Khanzada provoked Dilawar
            Khan to
            plan for a bigger attack on the Guru. So he sent Hussain Khan with a force of two thousand men. Hussain
            brought the
            Raja of Dadhwal to his knees and plundered Dun. Raja Kirpal of Kangra joined him. Bhim Chand too cast his
            lot with
            Hussain. He then with the help of Kirpal and Bhim Chand, planned to proceed to Anandpur. The Guru kept his
            troops
            ready for any eminent attack.</p>
        <p>When Hussain was preparing to march towards Anandpur, Raja Gopal of Guler sent his envoy to make peace with
            him.
            Hussain replied that he would be glad to meet with Raja Gopal if he gave him a subsidy as other Rajas had
            done.
            Gopal went with some money but Hussain was not pleased with his contribution. Hussain's terms were payment
            of ten
            thousand rupees or he would put Gopal and his troops to death. Gopal pleaded his inability to pay that large
            sum of
            money and thus came back. At this point Gopal sent his envoy to the Guru to pray to him for a negotiated
            settlement
            with Hussain. The Guru sent his agent, Sangtia with an escort of seven troopers to negotiate a peace
            settlement
            between Gopal and Hussain. Two parties could not reach any settlement with the result that a battle ensued
            between
            Hussain, Kirpal and Bhim Chand on one side and Raja Gopal and Raja Ram Singh on the other. Having fought
            very
            bravely Hussain perished in the battle field. Raja Kirpal of Kangra was also slain. Himmat and Kimmat, two
            officers
            of Hussain Khan were also killed. On the other side the Guru's envoy Sangtia and his seven troopers were all
            killed.
            On seeing this Bhim Chand fled with his army. After his victory Raja Gopal went to the Guru with large
            offerings and
            thanked him for his grace which made him successful in the battle field.</p>
        <p class="black">A third son, Zorawar Singh was born to the Guru on Sunday, the first day of the second half of the month of
            Magh,
            Sambat 1753 (1697 A.D.).</p>
        <p class="black">The defeat irked Dilawar Khan and he then sent Jujhar Singh and Chandel Rai to Jaswan but they could not
            achieve the
            purpose. They, however, captured Bhalan, a strategic place in that state. Before they could proceed further,
            Gaj
            Singh of Jaswal fell upon them. Jujhar Singh and Chandel Rai both fought like lions but Jujhar Singh as
            killed and
            Chandel Rai fled from the field.</p>
        <p class="black">The defeat of the imperial forces caused anxiety to Aurangzeb and he sent his son Prince Muazzam, later known
            as
            Bahadur Shah, for restoration of order in the hills. The Prince took charge in August, 1696 and deputed
            Mirza Beg to
            teach lesson to hill Rajas. He inflicted defeat after defeat, set up villages on fire, plundered the
            territory.
            After Mirza Beg, the Prince sent four more officers who, side by side, chastised the hill Rajas, plundered
            the homes
            of the apostates who had escaped destruction at the hands of Mirza Beg.</p>
        <p class="black">In due time a fourth son, Fateh Singh was born to the Guru on wednesday, the eleventh day of Phagan, Sambat
            755 (1699
            A.D.). In the state of seclusion and tranquility of the mountains, the Guru translated Sanskrit works in
            Sambat 1755
            ( 1698 A.D.). It was on the 14th of June of that year that the Guru according to his own version, completed
            his
            translation of the Ram Avtar from Sanskrit into Hindi. Most of the compositions that are said to be of the
            tenth
            Guru, are not his. Macauliffe writes:</p>
        <p>&quot;What is called the Granth of the tenth Guru (Dasam Granth) is only partially his composition. The</p>
        <p>greater portion of it was written by bards in his employ. The two works entitled Chandi Charitar and</p>
        <p>the Bhagauti ki Var found in it are abridged translations by different hands (any one even moderately</p>
        <p>acquainted with Hindi can tell from inner evidence of style that these translations have been done by</p>
        <p>different persons) of the Durga Sapt Shatti, or seven hundred sloks on the subject of Durga, an</p>
        <p>episode in the 'Markandeya Puran' on the contests of the goddess Durga with demons who had made</p>
        <p>war on the gods.&quot;</p>
        <p>There were fifty-two bards in the court of Guru Gobind Singh to translate the Mahabharat, the Ramayan, and
            the
            gallant achievements of Rama, Krishna, Chandi, and others. It does not follow from this that the Guru
            worshipped
            those whose acts were thus celebrated; this was only done for the purpose of inciting bravery and dispelling
            cowardice, and filling the hearts of his troops with valor to defend their faith. This the Guru himself
            declares in
            his translation of the tenth canto of the Bhagwat,&quot; I have rendered in the vulgar dialect the tenth
            chapter of
            the Bhagwat with no other object than to inspire ardour for religious warfare.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Guru never put faith or worshipped anyone other than the One Immortal God. In Akal Ustat he writes:</p>
        <p>&quot;Without Thee (God) I worship none Whatever boon I want, get from Thee.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Guru makes the above point clear in his thirty-three Swayas:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&quot;Some fasten an idol firmly to their breasts; some say that Shiv is God; Some say that God is in the</p>
        <p>temple of the Hindus; others believe that He is in the mosque of the Musalmans;</p>
        <p>Some say that Rama is God; some say Krishna; some in their hearts accept the incarnations as God;</p>
        <p>But I have forgotten all vain religion and know in my heart that the Creator is the only God.&quot;
            (Swaya-</p>
        <p>XII)</p>
        <p>&quot;Why call Shiv God, and why speak of Brahma as God?</p>
        <p>God is not Ram Chander, Krishan, or Vishnu whom ye suppose to be the lords of the world.</p>
        <p>Sukhdev, Prasar, and Vyas erred in abandoning the One God and worshipping many gods.</p>
        <p>All have set up false religions; I in every way believe that there is but One God.&quot;</p>
        <p>(Swaya- XV, Guru Gobind Singh)</p>
