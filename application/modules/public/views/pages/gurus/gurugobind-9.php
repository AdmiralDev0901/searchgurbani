        <h2 class="no-top">Sri Guru Gobind Singh Sahib Ji</h2>
        <p><strong><a name="1" id="1">GURU AT NADER:</a></strong></p>
        <p class="black">At Nader the Guru selected a lovely spot on the bank of the river Godavri. Two reasons are generally given
            for his
            choice of this place. Firstly he wanted to see Banda Bairagi and secondly there were eight Ashrams of
            different
            religious sects. The Guru wanted to enter into a dialogue with the leaders of the holy camps to show them
            the true
            path and to convert them to his own viewpoint. It was perhaps because of this that he immediately started
            addressing
            congregations. Crowds of people seeking spiritual light flocked to him. Soon it was indeed a model of
            'Anandpur'
            reproduced in the Daccan.</p>
        <p class="black">A news reached here that the Emperor's army had ransacked Sadhaura and treated Pir Budhu Shah as a rebel, for
            having
            faith in Guru Gobind Singh whom they considered as a 'Kafir' or infidel.</p>
        <p class="black">One day the Guru went to the place of Bairagi Madho Das, a hermit. Finding the Bairagi absent, and on hearing
            that he
            possessed supernatural powers who could overthrow any one who sat on his couch, the Guru took comfort in
            sitting on
            it. The Guru's followers killed a goat and had cooked it in the forbidden square of the Bairagi. A disciple
            went to
            inform the Bairagi of the Guru's actions. It was a sacrilege to kill an animal at the Bairagi's place and
            another
            sacrilege to take possession of the couch which served him as a throne. Bairagi was mad with anger and
            violently
            moved headlong towards the Guru. He tried all his powers to hurt him but in vain. When he found himself
            helpless, he
            asked the Guru who he was. The Guru replied that he was Gobind Singh. Bairagi was pacified and his anger
            suddenly
            transformed into worship. The Divine Light from the Guru's eyes dispelled all darkness from the mind of the
            Bairagi
            who immediately knelt before the Master and in total submission admitted that he was his (Guru's) Banda- a
            slave.</p>

        <p>The Master then instructed him on the tenets of Sikh religion a nd baptized him. He was named GurbakhshSingh
            but
            continued to be known as Banda or Banda Singh. He had heard from the Sikhs the atrocities of the Muslim
            rulers in
            the Punjab including the massacre of Guru's innocent children, thus, became ready for any service he could
            perform
            for the Master. Upon this the Guru instructed him to proceed to the Punjab and fight oppression of the
            rulers upon
            the Khalsa. Saying this he presented him with his bow and five arrows and addressed,&quot; As long as thou
            remainest
            continent, thy glory shall increase. He who is content, turneth not away from the combat, his opponents
            cannot
            withstand him. Once thou forsakest the Khalsa principles and associate unlawfully with woman, thy courage
            shall
            depart.&quot; The Guru despatched some Sikhs to assist him in this enterprise. Banda took the oath, bowed
            and
            departed. This was an outstanding example of Guru Gobind Singh's power to make sparrow to hunt the hawk and
            make one
            Sikh fight with one hundred twenty-thousand. Banda Bahadur who was a hermit wedded to the creed of
            non-violence, was
            made into the greatest general of the time by the Guru's power.</p>
        <p class="black">(Banda Bahadur planted the Guru's flag in a village about thirty-five miles of Delhi. The Sikhs from all over
            the
            Punjab gathered under his banner and made such powerful and devastating attacks that within a few months
            they razed
            Samana, Shahbad, Sadhaura and Chhat Banur to the ground. Next came Sirhind. Banda Bahadur made so strong and
            sweeping attack that the enemy could not stand against his army. Wazir Khan and his minister Suchnand were
            both put
            to sword. Emperor Bahadur Shah failed to crush him and died in delusion of victory over the Sikhs.)</p>
        <p class="black">After Banda's departure the Guru lived at various places in the neighborhood called Shikar Ghat where he used
            to go
            hunting, at Nagina Ghat where a Sikh presented him with a valuable signet ring which he threw into the
            river. At the
            Hira Ghat where he disposed of a similar valuable diamond ring, and also at a spot now called Sangat Sahib
            where he
            used to give religious instructions to his followers.</p>
        <p class="black">The close connections between the Guru and Emperor Bahadur Shah had alarmed Wazir Khan, the viceroy of
            Sirhind. He
            had ordered the infant sons of the Guru to be bricked alive in the wall and beheaded. It was he, who was
            responsible
            for inflicting most of the atrocities upon the Sikhs in the Punjab. He feared that his life would be in
            danger if
            the new Emperor and the Guru came to a compromise. He, therefore, conspired a plot to kill the Guru and he
            sent two
            Pathans, Gul Khan alias Jamshed Khan and Ata-ullah, to assassinate him.</p>
        <p class="black">All kinds of people started attending the congregations of the Guru at Nader. Soon the two Pathans also
            started
            coming to the assembly which was addressed by the Guru. On the third or fourth day, Jamshed Khan found an
            opportunity and as Guru Gobind Singh retired to his personal apartment after the evening prayer, he entered
            the
            apartment and, wounded him with a dagger. The Guru put him to death immediately, though he himself was
            wounded
            seriously. His fleeing companion was stabbed to death by a Sikh who rushed to the Guru's place hearing the
            noise.</p>
        <p class="black">Various views and stories have been expressed with regard to the circumstances of the assassination of the
            Guru.
            Cunningham writes that a Pathan merchant who had sold horses to the Guru, came one day and asked for
            immediate
            payment. The Guru who was short of funds, asked him to come some other day. The Pathan used an angry
            gesture, and
            his uttering of violence provoked the Guru to strike him dead. The body of the Pathan was removed and
            buried, and
            his family seemed reconciled to the fate. His sons nursed their revenge, and availed an opportunity of
            fulfilling
            it. They succeeded in stealing upon the Guru's retirement, and stabbed him mortally when asleep and
            unguarded.
            (Cunningham- History of Sikhs, p-82)</p>
        <p class="black">Other writers such as McGregor (History of Sikhs, vol.1 p-99- 100) states that the Guru shortly after,
            realized his
            mistake and as a recompense for the fate of the victim, the Guru showed special favor to the widow and
            brought up
            her son as a father would do. When the boy grew to manhood, he is said to have been incited by the Guru
            himself to
            strike him. The boy did it with fatal results for the Guru. Trumpp also believes in this version and to give
            a
            rationale to it, states that the Guru had been disgusted with life and wanted to end it.</p>

        <p>These stories are absolutely baseless. These writers should understand who the Guru was. Guru Gobind Singh
            was
            sitting on the divine throne of Guru Nanak, therefore, he was the embodiment of Divine Light; the Divine
            never feels
            disgusted or dejected. The Guru never uttered any word of grief nor did he show any sign of despair during
            the
            unparallel sufferings he went through. It is not recorded any place in his sermons or writings that he had
            ever
            expressed a sigh of grief. When Nura Mahi brought the news of the brutal massacre of his younger children,
            the Guru
            thanked God,&quot;Father, mother and four sons, all were Thy trust to me. Today I have been successful and
            happy in
            restoring that entire trust back to Thee.&quot; One can hardly find such an example in the annals of human
            history.
            In recent years fresh light is thrown by a Hukamnama according to which no demand for immediate payment was
            put
            before the Guru. The Pathan actually refused to make any demand when reminded of it by the Guru. This is
            shown by
            Hukamnana (letter of appreciation issued by the Guru) which the Guru granted to the Pathan for his good and
            friendly
            behavior and which is still preserved by the descendants of that Pathan. (Kartar Singh: Life of Guru Gobind
            Singh,
            p-263)</p>
        <p>A probe into the historical circumstances leads to the Emperor's involvement. The Emperor was enraged with
            the Guru
            for deputing Banda to Punjab to renew the struggle and kill Wazir Khan. Itseems that the Emperor was also
            afraid
            that the Guru might join the Marahattas in their battle against the Mughals during the time of his struggle
            with his
            brother at Hyderabad. It was perhaps for this reason, he was not leaving the Guru alone. Bahadur Shah had
            the
            mistaken belief that the Guru's death would be a fatal blow to his scheme of renewing the revolution in
            Punjab, he,
            therefore, entered into conspiracy with two Pathans deputed by Wazir Khan to put an end to Guru's life. The
            following historical facts testify this view:</p>
        <p class="black">On October 28, 1708, the Emperor ordered that a dress of mourning be presented to the son of Jamshed Khan
            Afghan who
            had been killed by Guru Gobind Singh. The imperial newsletter ofBahadur Shah's court records reads:</p>
        <p>&quot;Keh Guru Gobind Singh Rai Jamshed Khan Afghan ra bajan Kushtah bud khilat-e-Matami</p>
        <p>bapisar-i-Khan Mazkur Mrahmat shud.&quot; (Akhbarat-i-Darbar-i-Mualla, dated 24 Shaba, second year of</p>
        <p>Bahadur Shah (Oct. 28, 1708) quoted by Dr. Ganda Singh in Makhiz-i-Twarikh-i-Sikhan, p-83)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="black">Jamshed Khan was not a high dignitary upon whom the Emperor had to bestow high honors. He was only a spy of
            Wazir
            Khan.</p>
        <p class="black">Two days later on October 30, 1708, the Emperor ordered for the grant of a robe of mourning to Guru Gobind
            Singh's
            family.</p>
        <p class="black">It means that the Emperor treated Jamshed Khan and Guru Gobind Singh on equal footing, thereby confirming
            that
            Jamshed Khan enjoyed the patronage of the Emperor.</p>
        <p class="black">&quot;On November 11, 1708 it was represented that the deceased Guru left huge property.&quot; The courtiers
            asked
            how should it be disposed? It was ordered that such chattels would not replete the imperial treasury. &quot;This
            was
            the property of a darvesh (saint). There should be no interference with it,&quot; ordered the Emperor.</p>
        <p class="black">The Emperor's refusal to attach the property of the Guru against the will of his courtiers shows his
            diplomacy and
            cunningness. It was purely an eye-wash of his complicity, a pious fraud, writes H.R. Gupta in his 'A history
            of Sikh
            Gurus', p-240.</p>
        <p class="black">The Guru's wound was immediately stitched by the Emperor's European surgeon and within a few days it appeared
            to have
            been healed. Soon after when the Guru tugged at a hard strong bow, the imperfectly healed wound burst opened
            and
            caused profuse bleeding. It was now clear to him that the call of the Fatherfrom Heaven had come and he,
            therefore,
            gave his last and enduring message of his mission to the assembly of the Khalsa. He then opened the Granth
            Sahib,
            placed five paise and a coco-nut before it and solemnly bowed to it as his SUCCESSOR, GURU GRANTH SAHIB.
            Saying
            'Waheguru ji ka Khalsa, Waheguru ji ki Fateh', he circumambulated the sacred volume and proclaimed,&quot; O
            beloved
            Khalsa, let him who desireth to behold me, behold the Guru Granth. Obey the Granth Sahib. It is the visible
            body of
            the Gurus. And let him who desireth to meet me, diligently search its hymns.&quot; He then sang his
            self-composed
            hymn:</p>
        <p>&quot;Agya bhai Akal ki tabhi chalayo Panth</p>
        <p>Sabh Sikhan ko hukam hai Guru manyo Granth</p>
        <p>Guru Granth Ji manyo pargat Guran ki deh</p>
        <p>Jo Prabhu ko milbo chahe khoj shabad mein le</p>
        <p>Raj karega Khalsa aqi rahei na koe</p>
        <p>Khwar hoe sabh milange bache sharan jo hoe.&quot;</p>
        <p>Translation of the above:</p>
        <p>&quot;Under orders of the Immortal Being, the Panth was created. All the Sikhs are enjoined to accept the</p>
        <p>Granth as their Guru.</p>
        <p>Consider the Guru Granth as embodiment of the Gurus. Those who want to meet God, can find Him</p>
        <p>in its hymns. The Khalsa shall rule, and its opponents will be no more, Those separated will unite and</p>
        <p>all the devotees shall be saved.&quot;</p>
        <p>He, in grateful acknowledgement of the spiritual benefactions of the founder of his religion, uttered a
            Persian
            distich, the translation of which is:</p>
        <p>&quot;Gobind Singh obtained from Guru Nanak</p>
        <p>Hospitality, the sword, victory, and prompt assistance.&quot;</p>
        <p>(These lines were impressed on a seal made by the Sikhs after the Guru left for his heavenly abode, and were
            adopted
            by Ranjit Singh for his coinage after he had assumed the title of Maharaja in the Punjab)</p>
        <p>He then left for his heavenly abode. The Sikhs made preparations for his final rites as he had instructed
            them, the
            Sohila was chanted and Parsahd (sacred food) was distributed.</p>
        <p>While all were mourning the loss, a Sikh arrived and said,&quot; You sup pose that the Guru is dead. I met
            him this
            very morning riding his bay horse. After bowing to him when I asked whither he was going, he smiled and
            replied that
            he was going to the forest on a hunting excursion.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Sikhs who heard this statement arrived at the conclusion that it was all the Guru's play, that he dwelt
            in
            uninterrupted bliss, that he showed himself wherever he was remembered. He who treasures even a grain of the
            Lord's
            love in his heart, is the blessed one and the Guru reveals himself to such a devotee in mysterious ways.
            Wherefore
            for such a Guru who had departed bodily to Heaven, there ought to be no mourning.</p>
        <p>The Master returned to his Eternal Home on the 5th of the bright half of Katik, Sambat 1765 (7th October,
            1708 A.D.).
            He was 42 years of age.</p>
        <p>Before leaving this world, the Guru had ordained,&quot; If any one erects a shrine in my honor, his offspring
            shall
            perish.&quot;</p>
        <p>The Sikh temple at Nader is called Abchalnagar. It was built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1832 in defiance of
            the
            Guru's interdiction. After Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the rule of his dynasty, therefore, came to an end. Guru's
            prophecy was fulfilled.</p>
        <p>FN-1:One day a Sikh came and proposed to the Guru to wed his daughter, Sundri. The Guru did not desire the
            alliance
            but it was</p>
        <p>pressed on him by his mother. However it is believed that Sundri which means the beautiful, was an epithet of
            Jito
            and not a second wife of the Guru. It is also believed that Jito was the name given by her parents while
            Sundri was
            the name given to Mata Jitoji by the Guru's side. This frequently happens in the society.</p>
        <p>FN-2:Raipur is near Ambala. In the fort of Raipur is a Gurdwara on the spot where the Guru dined as the
            Rani's guest.
            There is also a Gurdwara outside the fort on the place where his tent was pitched.</p>
        <p>FN-3:Fifty-two bards were permanent in his employ but this number went as high as 94 at some point of
            time.</p>
        <p>FN-4:Some say that Himmat Chand was the third Sikh to come forward and Mohkam Chand was the fourth.</p>
        <p>FN-5:As a matter of fact there were five forts built at Anandpur in 1689. They were Anandgarh, Lohgarh,
            Fatehgarh,
            Kesgarh and Holgarh.</p>
        <p>FN-6:Vichitar Singh was not a very big person and this lance was weighing about 40 pounds and it is still
            present
            inside the fort Anandgarh at Anandpur.</p>
        <p>FN-7:The Guru was then expecting reinforcements of the Malwa Sikhs and that was the reason he was asking for
            delay.
            In fact the reinforcements did come, but arrived too late for the defence of Anandpur.</p>
        <p>FN-8:Some writers say that there were 1500 Sikhs who followed the Guru.</p>
        <p>FN-9:Bhai Jaita's name after baptism. Bhai Jaita had brought Guru Tegh Bahadur's head from Delhi to
            Anandpur.</p>
        <p>FN-10:A place about ten miles from Rupar.</p>
        <p>FN-11:Some writers say that there were eleven Sikhs left inside the Garhi at that time.</p>
        <p>FN-12:There is a Gurdwara called Tari Sahib on this spot where he clapped his hands. At Chamkaur Sahib there
            are four
            Gurdwaras. The first one is called Damdama Sahib where he rested before entering the Garhi; then Garhi Sa
            hib which
            was the fortress; then Katalgarh Sahib where the bodies of Guru's sons were cremated, and the last one is
            the Tari
            Sahib.</p>
        <p>FN-13: Chauri- it was a bunch of peacock's wings which were waved over him as mark of respect.</p>
        <p class="black">FN-14:Uch da Pir meant priest (Muslim faqir) of Uch, a town in the south western Punjab. The expression also
            meant
            high priest.</p>
        <p class="black">FN-15:It is also said that Guru met the elder brother of Bhai Mani Singh called Nagahia Singh. He and his son
            were
            horse merchants and they offered the horse to the Guru.</p>
        <p class="black">FN-16:It is stated in 'Suraj Parkash' that Tilok Singh and Ram Singh who were the sons of Baba Phul of
            Mehraj,
            cremated their bodies. They happened to be at Sirhind at that time.</p>
        <p class="black">FN-17:Guru Nanak had granted a boon to Mughal Emperor Babar for a long rule of his dynasty. Since the Mughal
            Monarchs
            resolved to injustice, falsehood, deceit, tyranny and oppression, their rule needed end. By digging up a
            shrub the
