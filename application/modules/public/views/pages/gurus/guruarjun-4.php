        <p><a name="GURU ARJAN:" id="GURU ARJAN:">MARTYRDOM OF GURU ARJAN:</a></p>
        <p class="black">During the rein of Guru Arjan, crowds were converted to Sikhism in Punjab and in various other
            parts of India and
            even in the neighboring countries. It is said that the hilly Rajas of Kulu, Suket, Haripur and Chamba
            visited the
            Guru and became his followers as did the Raja of Mandi. Guru's fame and influence became widely spread.</p>
        <p class="black">At that time Chandu Lal was Emperor Akbar's Diwan or financial advisor. He was a Khatri by
            caste and was originally
            an inhabitant of Rohela village in Gurdaspur district of Punjab. His official duties necessitated him to
            reside in
            Delhi. He had a young daughter of extreme beauty. Her mother, one day, said to her father,&quot;Our daughter
            is
            growing to maturity. We should search for a husband for her.&quot; Chandu Lal, therefore, sent his family
            priest and
            barber in search for a suitable match for his daughter. The priest and the barber searched every city in the
            Punjab
            but could not find a satisfactory match. One day again Chandu's wife insisted that they should continue
            their
            efforts. So the priest and the barber were again despatched for the purpose. They searched and searched and
            when
            they reached Lahore, they heard about the Guru's young son, Har Gobind. They went to Amritsar and found Har
            Gobind
            as the most descent match for the young girl. They came back and reported to Chandu accordingly. They gave
            their
            analysis on the excellence of Har Gobind and the enormous respect that his father was commanding in the city
            of
            Amritsar. Chandu was not pleased hearing praises of the Guru, so he asked the priest and the barber,&quot;Do
            you
            think him equal to me? Guru's caste is inferior to me. You desire to put the ornamental tile of top storey
            into a
            gutter! Where am I, the imperial finance minister; and where is the Guru, though he may be an object of
            veneration
            to his followers?&quot;</p>

                    <p align="left">The atmosphere was highly charged. Jahangir was hot with rage, so were Sulhi Khan
                        and Sulbi
                        Khan. Prithi Chand burning with jealousy. All these prompted Jahangir to torture Guru Arjan to
                        the
                        extreme. He was made to sit on a hot plate with hot burning sand being poured on him. The Guru
                        breathed
                        his last in 1606 Ad by going to the River Ravi for a dip and eventually disappearing. </p></th>

        <p class="black">After the husband and wife had argued the whole night over the matter, it was decided that Sada Kaur (their
            daughter)
            should be given in marriage to Har Gobind. The marriage presents were, therefore, dispatched to Amritsar. It
            came to
            the ears of the Sikhs of Delhi that Chandu had used derogatory expressions for the Guru. They sent a
            messenger with
            a letter explaining Chandu's utterances and prayed to the Guru to reject his alliance. The Sikhs of Delhi as
            well as
            of Amritsar prayed that the alliance of a haughty head like Chandu should not be accepted. The Guru was
            obliged to
            accept the advice of his Sikhs and so with utmost humility he told the matchmakers,&quot;I am contented with
            my
            humble lot and desire not an alliance with the great. An ornamental tile should not be put in a gutter.&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">While the matchmakers were still remonstrating, a Sikh, Narain Das, a grandson of Bhai Paro (a famous Sikh of
            Guru
            Amar Das) stood in the congregation and beseeched the Guru,&quot;O king, I am the dust of thy lotus feet. I
            have a
            daughter whom my wife and I have vowed to offer to thy son. If you make her the slave of thy feet, I shall
            be
            fortunate. I am a poor unhonored Sikh and thou art the honor of the unhonored.&quot; The uru replied,&quot;If
            you
            have love in your heart, then your proposal is acceptable to me.&quot; Narain Das at once went and purchased
            the
            marriage presents and betrothal ceremony was performed. Upon this another Sikh, Hari Chand stood up and
            appealed,&quot;O
            true king, I have vowed to give my daughter to thy son. If my petition please thee, I will give my daughter
            as a
            servant to Har Gobind.&quot; The Guru though unwilling at first to accept a second wife for his son, felt
            that he
            could not reject the offer of a faithful Sikh.</p>
        <p class="black">All this happened in the presence of Chandu's matchmakers who went back to Delhi and disappointed their
            master with
            sad news. Chandu was very much incensed and he wrote a letter to the Guru apologizing for his thoughtless
            expressions. He pleaded with the Guru that if he accepted his alliance, he would give large dowry to his
            daughter
            and he would have many favors conferred on him (Guru) by the Emperor. In the end he wrote that he was
            already on bad
            terms with his brother Prithi Chand and if he fell out with him too, it might ignite a blazing fire which
            would be
            difficult to extinguish.</p>
        <p class="black">He despatched the letter with the priest. The Guru having read it, stated,&quot;It is the pride that ruins
            men. Man
            suffers for his acts. They whom the Creator joineth, are united and they whom men joineth, are not. It is
            the Guru's
            rule to comply with the wishes of his Sikhs. Their words are immutable. As for his threats, I have no fear
            because
            God is the guardian of all.&quot; The priest returned with this message. This set the stage for Chandu's
            evil
            designs against the Guru.</p>
        <p class="black">The Emperor Akbar died soon after and was succeeded by his son Jahangir. Akbar had nominated his grandson
            Khusro in
            supersession of his son. Khusro claimed Punjab and Afghanistan which his father, Jahangir, was unwilling to
            concede
            to him. Jahangir ordered Khusro's arrest but the latter escaped and went towards Afghanistan. On his way he
            visited
            the Guru at Tarn Taran and told him that he was unfriended, needy, poor and had no travelling expenses. So
            he begged
            the Guru for pecuniary assistance.</p>
        <p class="black">Khusro had previously visited the Guru accompanying his grandfather Akbar and was, therefore, very well known
            to him.
            Secondly in Guru's house everybody- friend or foe, king or pauper, is treated equally. The Guru knew what
            was
            coming, but seeing the plight of the prince, he gave Khusro financial help. Khusro was, however, seized
            while
            crossing Jehlum, by the imperial forces and was brought in chains to his father.</p>
        <p class="black">Prithia continued to retain the assistance and co-operation of Sulhi Khan against the Guru. On the pretext of
            collecting revenue in the Punjab, Sulhi Khan obtained leave from the Emperor. On his way he visited
            Prithia</p>
        <p class="black">at his village Kotha where they concocted plans for the Guru's destruction. In the meantime, however, Prithia
            took
            Sulhi Khan to show his brick-kilns, where Sulhi Khan met with his accidental death by his sudden fall in the
            live
            brick-kiln.</p>
        <p class="black">Prithia was very much saddened at the death of his ally in evil. In those circumstances Chandu came to his
            rescue and
            filled the gap. Chandu wrote to Prithia to use his influence to bring his daughter's alliance with Har
            Gobind.
            Prithia was ready to assist Chandu in his nefarious designs against the Guru. He wrote back that the Guru
            who had
            deprived him of his right over Guruship, was already his enemy; and he would only be too happy to assist in
            meting
            him with adequate punishment. In his letter he begged Chandu to use his influence with the Emperor to bring
            the Guru
            to justice. So they both concocted a plan to induce the Emperor by some means to visit Punjab where they
            would have
            an opportunity to enter into some conspiracy against the Guru.</p>
        <p class="black">Chandu's scheme was successful and in a short period of time the Emperor came to Punjab. He told the Emperor
            that
            Guru Arjan was acting as his rival in Punjab by entertaining thieves and exercising independent authority.
            Upon this
            the Emperor sent an order to the Guru through Sulabi Khan, the nephew of late Sulhi Khan, to abstain from
            such
            practices. On his journey to Amritsar, Sulabi Khan confronted with some Pathans and was killed. When Chandu
            heard
            the death of Sulabi Khan, he convinced the Emperor that ithad been done through the machinations of the
            Guru. He
            added that he had done many such misdeeds. For example the Guru had deprived his elder brother Prithi Chand
            of his
            rights over Guruship and had also endeavored to deprive Hindus and Muslims of their religions. The Emperor
            immediately sent for Prithia who was overjoyed with the invitation. He made preparations to go to the
            Emperor but
            after the dinner he got a cramp in his stomach and died the same night.</p>
        <p class="black">Meharban, son of Prithia, wasted no time after the death of his father in informing Chandu who in turn
            informed the
            Emperor that the Guru had blessed Khusro and had promised that he would become the Emperor. The Emperor was
            also
            notified that the Pundits and the Qazis were enraged at the compilation of Adi Granth which blasphemed the
            worship
            rules of the Hindus and the prayer and fasting of the Muslims. By such accusations, Chandu induced the
            Emperor to
            summon Guru Arjan.</p>
        <p><strong>Emperor Jahangir writes in his autobiography:</strong></p>
        <p class="black">&quot;In Goindwal, which is on the river Biyah (Beas), there was a Hindu named Arjan, in the garments of
            sainthood
            and sanctity so much so, that he had captured many of the simple- hearted of the Hindus and even the
            ignorant and
            foolish followers of Islam, by his ways and manners, and they had loudly sounded the drum of his holiness.
            They
            called him Guru and from all sides stupid people crowded to worship and manifest complete faith in him. For
            three or
            four generations (of spiritual successors) they kept this shop warm. Many times it occurred to me to put a
            stop to
            this vain affair or to bring him into the assembly of the people of Islam.</p>
        <p class="black">At last, when Khusro passed along this road, this insignificant fellow proposed to wait upon him. Khusro
            appened to
            halt at the place where he was, and he came out and did homage to him. Hebehaved to Khusro in certain pecial
            ways,
            and made on his forehead a finger-mark of saffron which the Indians call Qashqa and is considered
            propitious. When
            this came to my ears and I fully knew his heresies, I ordered that he should be brought into my presence and
            having
            handed over his houses, dwelling places, and children to Murtaza Khan (Sheikh Farid Bukhari) and having
            confiscated
            his property I ordered that he should be put to death with tortures.&quot;</p>

        <p align="left"><strong>The following events led to the Guru's summons by the Emperor resulting in
                martyrdom:</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="black">To begin with, it was his elder brother, Prithi Chand who devoted his whole life to harm the Guru in every
            possible
            way. Secondly Chandu's animosity over his daughter's non-alliance with the Guru's son, is considered the
            main fuel.
            These men with jealousies in their hearts, concocted the real story of Khusro to rouse the ire of Emperor
            Jahangir
            which added fuel to the blazing fire. Along with these circumstances Guru's increasing influence to convert
            crowds
            of Hindus and Muslims, created a stir in the minds of the Pundits (Brahmans) and the Qazis (Muslim priests).
            The
            compilation of Adi Granth was considered a serious blow to other religions. Through all these circumstances
            Guru
            Arjan fell a victim to the bigotry and inhumanity of the Mohammadan Emperor.</p>
        <p class="black">Before his departure to Lahore, the Guru appointed his son, Har Gobind as his successor and gave suitable
            instructions. He took five Sikhs, Bhai Bidhi Chand, Bhai Langaha, Bhai Piara, Bhai Jetha, and Bhai Pirana,
            with him.
            Some writers say that Emperor Jahangir had gone to Kashmir before the arrival of the Guru in Lahore. The
            Emperor
            Jahangir addressed the Guru,&quot;Thou art a saint, a great teacher, and a holy man; You look on all, rich
            and poor,
            alike. It was therefore, not proper for you to give money to my enemy Khusro.&quot; The Guru replied,&quot;I
            regard
            all people, whether Hindu or Musalman, rich or poor, friend or foe, as equals; and it is on this account
            that I gave
            your son some money for his journey, and not because he was in opposition to you. If I had not assisted him
            in his
            forlorn condition, and so shown some regard for the kindness of thy father, Emperor Akbar to myself, all men
            would
            have despised me for my heartlessness and ingratitude, or they would have said that I was afraid of you.
            This would
            have been unworthy of a follower of Guru Nanak.&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">The Guru's reply did not sooth Jahangir's feelings and he ordered him to pay two lakhs of rupees (two hundred
            thousand rupees), and also to erase the hymns in his Granth which were opposed to the Hindu and Muslim
            religions.
            The Guru replied, &quot;Whatever money I have is for the poor, the friendless and the stranger. If you ask
            for
            money, you may take whatever I have; but if you ask for it by way of fine I shall not give you even a penny,
            because
            a fine is imposed on the wicked worldly persons and not on priests and saints. As regarding the erasure of
            hymns in
            the Adi Granth, I cannot erase or alter an iota. I am a worshipper of the Immortal God. There is no monarch
            save
            Him; and what He revealed to the Gurus, from Guru Nanak to Guru Ram Das, and afterwards to myself, is
            written in the
            holy Granth. The hymns contained in the Adi Granth are not disrespectful to any Hindu incarnation or any
            Mohammadan
            prophet. It is certainly stated that prophets, priests, and incarnations are the handiwork of the Immortal
            God,
            Whose limit none can find. My main object is to spread the truth and the destruction of falsehood; and if,
            in
            pursuance to this objective, this perishable body is to depart, I shall account it great good
            fortune.&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">The Emperor left and the Guru was placed under the surveillance of Chandu. Some writers say that Guru Arjan's
            execution was nothing except usual punishment of revenue defaulter. It seems that these writers are totally
            ignorant
            of Sikh tradition. When the Sikhs of Lahore came to know about the fine of two lakhs of rupees, they decided
            to
            raise the money to discharge the Guru's obligation of fine. The Guru issued a stern warning to his Sikhs
            that
            whosoever contributed to pay the fine imposed on him, would not be his Sikh. It was a matter of principle as
            mentioned in the Guru's reply above, and not a matter of two lakhs of rupees which could have been collected
            in
            twinkling of an eye. Fines are for thieves, robbers, slanderers and the wicked. Men devoted to religion did
            not
            belong to that category. It is, therefore, baseless to say that Guru's execution was usual punishment of
            revenue
            defaulter. The Qazis and Brahmans offered alternatives to the Guru to exchange death for expunging the
            alleged
            objectionable passages in Adi Granth and inserting the praises of Mohammad and of the Hindu deities. The
            Guru did
            not budge from his position.</p>
        <p class="black">Guru Arjan was made to sit on the red hot iron pan and burning sand was poured over his bare body. He was
            seated in
            red-hot caldron, and was bathed in boiling water. Guru's body was burning and was full of blisters.</p>
        <p class="black">His friend and devotee, Mian Mir, a Muslim saint, rushed to see him. When Mian Mir saw the ghastly scene, he
            cried
            out and said,&quot;O Master! I cannot bear to see these horrors inflicted on thee. If you permit me, I would
            demolish this tyrant rule (Mian Mir is said to have possessed supernatural powers at that time).&quot; The
            Guru
            smiled and asked Mian Mir to look towards the skies. It is said that Mian Mir saw Angels begging the Guru's
            permission to destroy the wicked and the proud.</p>
        <p class="black">The Guru addressed Mian Mir,&quot;Mian Mir, you are perturbed too soon. This is the Will of my Master (God),
            and I
            cheerfully submit and surrender to His Sweet Will.&quot; The Guru repeated and exemplified in action the
            meaning of
            this verse:</p>
        <p><em>&quot;Tera kia meetha lagei</em></p>
        <p><em>Har Nam padarath Nanak mangei.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><em>(Asa Mohalla 5, p-394)</em></p>
        <p><em>'Sweet be Thy Will, my Lord</em></p>
        <p><em>Nanak beseecheth the gift of Nam.'</em></p>
        <p><em>(Translation of the above)</em></p>
        <p><em>The Guru bore all this torture with equanimity and never uttered a sigh or a groan.</em></p>
        <p><em>The Guru was unruffled!</em></p>
        <p><em>The Guru remained calm and unperturbed like a sea!</em></p>
        <p><em>The Guru was in Absolute Bliss!</em></p>
        <p><em>This was the wonder of the Lord- an unparallel example</em></p>
        <p><em>in the history of mankind.</em></p>
        <p class="black">Mian Mir asked, why was he enduring the suffering at the hands of his vile sinners when he ossesseth
            superpowers? The
            Guru replied,&quot;I bear all this torture to set an example to the Teachers of True Name, that they may not
            lose
            patience or rail at God in affliction. The true test of faith is the hour of misery. Without examples to
            guide them,
            ordinary persons' minds quail in the midst of suffering.&quot; Upon this Mian Mir departed commending the
            Guru's
            fortitude and singing his praises.</p>
        <p class="black">The Guru was again addressed to comply with the demands of his enemies. When he was threatened with further
            torture,
            he replied,&quot;O fools! I shall never fear any torture. This is all according to God's Will, any torture
            wherefore
            affordeth my pleasure.&quot; He is said to have uttered this Sabad:</p>
        <p><em>&quot;The egg of superstition hath burst; the mind is illumined;</em></p>
        <p><em>The Guru hath cut the fetters off the feet and freed the captive.</em></p>
        <p><em>My transmigration is at an end.</em></p>
        <p><em>The heated caldron hath become cold; the Guru hath given the cooling Name.</em></p>
        <p><em>Since the holy man hath been with me, Death's myrmidons,</em></p>
        <p><em>who lay in wait for me, have left me.</em></p>
        <p><em>I have been released from him who restrained me; what shall the judge do to me now?</em></p>
        <p><em>The load of karma is removed; I am freed therefrom.</em></p>
        <p><em>From the sea I have reached the shore; the Guru hath done me this favor.</em></p>
        <p><em>True is my place, true my seat, and truth I have made my special object.</em></p>
        <p><em>Truth is the capital; truth the stock-in-trade which Nanak hath put into his house.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><em>(Maru Mohalla 5, p-1002)</em></p>
        <p class="black">Chandu thought to suffocate him in a fresh cowhide, in which he was to be sewn up. Instead the Guru asked for
            a bath
            in Ravi river which flowed embracing the walls of Lahore city. Chandu revelled at the thought that the
            Guru's body
            full of blisters, would undergo greater pain when dipped in cold water and hepermitted him to bathe in the
            river.
            The soldiers were sent to escort the Guru. The Master's disciples saw him leaving. He looked at them still
            forbidding any action. He said,&quot;Such is the Will of my God, submit tothe Divine Will, move not, stand
            calm
            against ll woes.&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">Crowds watched the Master standing in water and having a dip. Lo! The light blended with Light and the body
            was found
            nowhere. Hail to the Master! Thou art Wonderful- Martyr, the greatest. Thou art the Greatest! </p>
        <p><a name="SALUTE" id="SALUTE">SALUTE TO THE MIGHTY KING!</a></p>
        <p>In Sikhism there is the same emphasis on Raza also called Bhana (God's Will) as there is on renunciation
            in</p>
        <p class="black">ascetic cults and creeds. It is a state of mind which understands clearly the Divine Will. The doctrine of
            Bhana is
            the acceptance of the Will of God which is the core of Sikh faith. An enlightened mind lives according to
            inner
            dictates of His Hukam (order). It is a dedicated submission and infinite patience to accept His Will. Guru
            Arjan
            sowed the seed of martyrdom which largely flourished after him and became the heritage of the Sikhs.</p>
        <p class="black">To justify and substantiate that prophets and saints can conquer death and suffering, two Sikh Gurus and
            countless
            Sikhs have faced martyrdom. They did so to show to the world their belief in the eternity of their spirit
            and the
            fearlessness they acquired in the love of God. It is a lesson to the world that true devotion to God
            transcends the
            sorrow of life. The Master is not indifferent to the values and to the suffering of the virtuous at the
            hands of the
            wicked. To save and defend is His Characteristic (Birdh). He cares for devotion of His devotees and guards
            His
            prophets and saints from misery unless He wills and desires that their agonizing experience and painful
            martyrdom
            should serve higher purpose.</p>
        <p>This was the fourth day of the light half of the month of Jeth, Sambat 1663 (May 30, 1606 A.D.).</p>
        <p><strong>FN-1:</strong> Work was not interfered with from any direction.</p>
        <p><strong>FN-2:</strong> Ramdas may also mean here God's servant.</p>
        <p><strong>FN-3</strong>: John Clark Archer writes in his book, 'The Sikhs' that Har Gobind was not a real son
            of Guru
            Arjan but he was an adopted son. As we see in the above narrated Sabad, the Guru thanked God for His
            blessing over
            the birth of his son. Also the entire Sikh world believes that Guru Har Gobind was Guru Arjan's son. God
            knows what
            was Archer's source of such a misleading information. He should have shown some sense of responsibility
            while
            writing on such a sensitive subject. There are many such serious irregularities in his book and we take a
            very
            serious note of them.</p>
        <p><strong>FN-4:</strong> Means Guru Granth Sahib.</p>
        <p><strong>FN-5:</strong> It was customary in those days to send the family priest and the family barber to find
            suitable match.</p>
        <p class="black"><strong>FN-6:</strong> The Gurus were held in such high esteem that religious people frequently thought it
            their duty
            to vow to them their lives, their children, and their property. Several Sikhs used to register oaths on the
            birth of
            their daughters that they would only bestow them on the Guru or his relations. None would marry them except
            those to
            whom they were vowed. The Guru, therefore, felt bound to meet the wishes and vows of his Sikhs.</p>
        <p class="black"><strong>FN-7:</strong> The Gurus were held in such high esteem that religious people frequently thought it

        <p class="black">FN-8: As we will see later on, Jahangir wrote that the Guru made a tilak (patch) of saffron on Khusro's
            forehead
            which implied that the Guru had blessed Khusro with Emperorship. This was not true. It seems that it was a
            concocted
            story of Guru's enemies to excite Jahangir against him.</p>
