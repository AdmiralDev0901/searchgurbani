                    Nanak received a Hukam (commandment) from God instructing him to
                    spread a message of truth based on devotion to One God, honesty,
                    and compassion. The soul of Guru Nanak passed on to nine successors,
                    who elaborated on the first Guru's teachings to give form to this
                    new religion. The final form was given by the tenth and last Guru,
                    Gobind Singh, who started the Sikh initiation ceremony: initiated
                    Sikhs formed a community of saint-soldiers known as Khalsa, the
                    Pure Ones. Guru Gobind Singh also made it clear that, after him,
                    the Guru-eternal for Sikhs would be their holy scripture, Guru Granth
                    Sahib.</p>

                <p class="black"><a href="<?php echo base_url('gurus/gurunanak'); ?>"><strong>1. GURU NANAK DEV
                            JI</strong></a><br>
                    Born in 1469 to a Hindu family near the city of Lahore (now a part of
                    Pakistan), Guru Nanak was the founder of Sikhism. The young Nanak
                    enjoyed the company of holy men and engaged them in long discussions
                    about the nature of God. Around the year 1500, Nanak had a revelation
                    from God; and shortly thereafter, he uttered the words:</p>
                <p>There is No Hindu, There is No Muslim</p>
                <p class="black">This
                    pronouncement was substantial as it referred to the day and age
                    in which Guru Nanak lived: Hindus and Muslims of India constantly
                    and bitterly fought each other over the issue of religion. The Guru
                    meant to emphasize that, ultimately, in the eyes of God, it is not
                    religion that determines a person's merits, but one's actions.</p>
                <p>The
                    Guru witnessed the Mughal invasion of India, and saw the horrors
                    inflicted upon the common people by the invaders. Though a pacifist,
                    Guru Nanak did not hesitate to speak up against injustice:</p>
                <p>The
                    kings are ravenous beasts, their ministers are dogs.</p>
                <p>The
                    Age is a Knife, and the Kings are Butchers<br>
                    In this dark night of evil, the moon of righteousness is nowhere
                    visible.</p>
                <p>Guru
                    Nanak laid forth three basic principles by which every human being
                    should abide:<br>
                    1. Remember the name of God at all times.<br>
                    2. Earn an honest living as a householder.<br>
                    3. Share a portion of your earnings with the less fortunate.</p>
                <p class="black">Besides
                    rejecting the Hindu caste system, idolatry, and ritualism, Guru
                    Nanak preached universal equality. In consistence with his message
                    of equality, Guru Nanak scorned those who considered women to be
                    evil and inferior to men by asking:</p>
                <p><i>Why
                        should we call her inferior, when it is she who gives birth to great
                        persons?</i></p>
                <p class="black">Guru
                    Nanak has been documented to have traveled across India and the
                    Middle East to spread his message. Once, at Mecca, the Guru was
                    resting with his feet pointing toward the holy shrine. When a Muslim
                    priest angrily reprimanded the Guru for showing disrespect to God,
                    the Guru replied, "Kindly point my feet toward the place where
                    God does not exist." Among the many philosophical foundations
                    laid by Guru Nanak , his characterization of God, as illustrated
                    by his visit to Mecca, is most recognizable. It forms the opening
                    lines of the 1430 page Sikh holy scripture, Guru Granth Sahib. The
                    translation is as follows:</p>
                <p><i>There
                        is but One God, The Supreme Truth; The Ultimate Reality, The Creator,
                        Without fear, Without enemies, Timeless is His image, Without Birth,
                        Self Created, By His grace revealed.</i></p>
                <p class="black">Like
                    all the Gurus after him, Guru Nanak preached by example. During
                    a time of great social disarray and religious decay, his message
                    served as a fresh, uncorrupted approach toward spirituality and
                    God. The message of the Guru took almost 240 years to unfold, and
                    so, in accordance with the Will of God, the soul of Guru Nanak merged
                    into the souls of his nine successors.</p>
                <p class="black"><a href="<?php echo base_url('gurus/guruangad'); ?>"><strong>2.
                            GURU ANGAD </strong></a><br>
                    Besides maintaining and upholding
                    the traditions laid forth by Guru Nanak, the second Guru created
                    the Gurmukhi script, a medium through which the writings and teachings
                    of the Sikh gurus could be readily understood by their followers.
                    By disassociating the Sikh tradition from Sanskrit influence, a
                    script and language largely unknown to the masses, the Guru emphasized
                    the universality and widespread accessibility of Sikh religious
                    thought. Moreover, it solidified the idea that Sikhism started as
                    a distinct and revealed religion.</p>
                <p class="black"><a href="<?php echo base_url('gurus/guruamar'); ?>"><strong>3. GURU AMAR DAS </strong></a><br>
                    The third Sikh Guru reinforced
                    the teachings of the previous Gurus by organizing the construction
                    of twenty-two centers of religious learning for the Sikhs. Like
                    his predecessors, he sharply criticized the practice of sati, where widows immolated themselves on
                    the funeral
                    pyres of their
                    dead husbands. The Guru also required that anyone wishing to meet
                    him would have to first partake in the common kitchen, called Langar,
                    as a sign of equality. The Emperor Akbar, Muslim ruler of India,
                    himself followed this tradition before meeting with the Guru.</p>
                <p class="black"><a href="<?php echo base_url('gurus/gururamdas'); ?>"><strong>4.
                            GURU RAM DAS</strong></a><br>
                    Founder of the city of Amritsar,
                    site of the Golden Temple, Guru Ram Das worked to ensure the city's
                    growth by encouraging commercial and trade ventures in the town.
                    Soon, with the city flourishing as a trade center and place of pilgrimage,
                    the Sikhs had a distinct religious center of their own.</p>
                <p class="black"><a href="<?php echo base_url('gurus/guruarjun'); ?>"><strong>5.
                            GURU ARJAN</strong></a><br>
                    The fifth Guru started the construction
                    of the Golden Temple. To emphasize the universality of Sikhism,
                    the foundation stone of the shrine was laid by a Muslim saint, named
                    Mian Mir. Also, the temple featured four entrances to represent
                    access to <u>all</u> communities. Guru Arjan compiled the Adi Granth,
                    the Sikh scripture containing the writings of all the Gurus up until
                    that time (the writings of the eighth Guru were added by Guru Gobind
                    Singh). As another sign of the universality of Sikh philosophy,
                    the Guru added the writings of several Muslim and Hindu saints,
                    whose ideas corresponded to Sikh beliefs. With the passage of time,
                    the Guru attracted a substantial following; and therefore, the Sikh
                    community assumed a socio-political character. In 1606, Emperor
                    Jehangir, the Muslim ruler of India, summoned the Guru to his court
                    on the charge of blessing a rebellious relative of the Emperor's.
                    Upon the Guru's refusal to embrace Islam to escape death, the fifth
                    prophet of the Sikh religion was subject to inhumane torture and
                    killed. Thus, the martyrdom tradition of Sikhism began with the
                    martyrdom of the Guru himself. From this point forward, Sikhism
                    began to form itself into a community of saint-soldiers.</p>
                <p class="black"><a href="<?php echo base_url('gurus/guruhargobindi'); ?>"><strong>6.
                            GURU HAR GOBIND</strong></a><br>
                    Responsible for establishing idea
                    of the inseparability of spiritual and temporal matters, the sixth
                    Guru maintained an army for the purpose of protecting the poor and
                    destroying tyrants. He constructed the Akal Takht, center of temporal
                    affairs in the Sikh religion, across from the Golden Temple in Amritsar.
                    By this time, the Sikh community was a full-fledged social, religious,
                    and political entity.</p>
                <p class="black"><a href="<?php echo base_url('gurus/guruharrai'); ?>"><strong>7.
                            GURU HAR RAI</strong></a><br>
                    The seventh Guru continued the mission
                    of organizing the Sikhs into a military force that would be equipped
                    and ready, both spiritually and physically, to counter the repressive
                    Mughal empire.</p>
                <p class="black"><a href="<?php echo base_url('gurus/guruharkrishan'); ?>"><strong>8.
                            GURU HAR KRISHAN</strong></a><br>
                    At only five years of age, the eighth
                    Sikh Guru was the youngest. He worked to alleviate the suffering
                    of the common man during a smallpox epidemic in Delhi, but succumbed
                    to the disease himself at the age of eight.</p>
                <p class="black"><a href="<?php echo base_url('gurus/guruteghbhadur'); ?>"><strong>9.
                            GURU TEGH BAHADUR</strong></a><br>
                    The Mughal Emperor of India,
                    Aurangzeb, attempted to consolidate India into one Islamic nation.
                    In order to achieve this aim, he set out to virtually eliminate
                    Hinduism from India. When the eighth Guru heard of this from a desperate
                    group of Hindus, he challenged the Emperor that, in order to convert
                    all the Hindus, the Guru himself would have to embrace Islam. When
                    the Guru was imprisoned at the request of Aurangzeb in 1675, despite
                    being forced to watch the torture and execution of two disciples,
                    the Guru simply refused to concede to the Emperor's demand. Finally,
                    the Guru was ordered to get beheaded. Unparalleled in the history
                    of humankind, the martyrdom of Guru Teg Bahadur was an act of sacrifice
                    for another religious community. The Guru's martyrdom served to
                    awaken the collective conscience of the Sikh community, which was
                    about to undergo a final transformation in the years to follow.</p>
                <p class="black"><a href="<?php echo base_url('gurus/gurugobind'); ?>">
                        <strong>10. GURU GOBIND SINGH</strong></a><br>
                    Upon the death of his father, Guru Gobind Singh felt compelled to organize
                    the Sikhs into a community of saint-soldiers. During the spring
                    of 1699, the Guru called his followers for a special gathering.
                    During the day, thousands of people assembled in front of a stage
                    and a tent, out of which emerged the Guru to address the massive
                    audience. With sword in hand, the Guru asked the congregation if
                    anyone would be willing to sacrifice their head for him. Naturally,
                    the audience was stunned by the Guru's request, and many followers
                    began to disperse out of sheer terror. Still, the Guru pressed for
                    one of his followers to give their life for him. Finally, one of
                    the assembled stood, with hands folded, and approached the Guru
                    in full submission. The lone disciple was led into the tent by the
                    Guru. After some time, the Guru emerged with a blood-stained sword
                    and asked for another head. Overcome with shock, the audience could
                    not believe what they were seeing; however, another devoted follower
                    stood and offered his head to the Guru. Eventually, with the same
                    outcome, three more devoted disciples offered their lives to the
                    Guru. After the fifth devotee was led into the tent, to the surprise
                    of the massive audience, the Guru emerged with the five followers
                    fully clothed in the uniform of the Khalsa, or Pure. The Guru's
                    demonstration symbolized a revitalization of the Sikh identity and
                    the definitive evolution of the Sikh community into a community
                    of saint-soldiers. After initiating the five "beloved ones"
                    into the new order of the Khalsa, the Guru knelt before them and
                    requested that they initiate him. In the annals of human history,
                    such a transformation into a distinct and solidified community,
                    culminating in the baptism of the prophet by his followers, remains
                    a unique and defining moment.</p>
                <p class="black">Guru
                    Gobind Singh and his Khalsa army were engaged in several battles
                    against the imperialist Mughal army during the Guru's life. Through
                    the course of those turbulent times, the Guru lost his four children
                    and his mother to the cause of righteousness; but nevertheless,
                    the Khalsa stood firm as a distinct and sovereign entity, able to
                    withstand the onslaught of a mighty enemy.</p>
                <p>In
                    the face of persecution, the Guru wrote:</p>
                <p>When
                    all peaceful means of resolution have failed, it is righteous to
                    draw the sword.</p>
                <p class="black"> Before
                    his death at the hands of an assailant in 1708, the Guru added the
                    writings of Guru Tegh
                    Bahadur to the Sikh scriptures, thereby giving a final revision
                    to its form. The Guru also declared the lineage of living Gurus
                    finished, and requested his followers to seek spiritual guidance
                    from the <a href="<?php echo base_url('guru-granth-sahib/introduction'); ?>">Guru Granth Sahib.</a>
                    In essence,
                    the light of Nanak, the first Guru, was to be forever
                    enshrined within the pages of the <a
