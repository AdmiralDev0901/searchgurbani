        <h2 class="no-top">Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji </h2>
        <p class="black"><a name="1" id="1"><strong>GURU AT GAYA</strong></a><br/>
            After Banaras he reached Gaya which is a famous Hindu pilgrimage place situated at the river Phalgu (Sarju).
            The
            Hindu priests had declared that any offerings made at Gaya especially at the time of Baisakhi would secure
            salvation
            for seven generations of those who had departed from this world. The simple minded people made huge
            offerings and
            the priests fed the piters (ancestors) by offering rice balls, lighted up little lamps to illuminate their
            paths in
            the high heavens. The Guru started laughing which made the priests very angry. At that point the Guru
            explained that
            those who left their bodies on earth, did not need any food nor a glow of lamp to see. If this body could
            not go to
            the other world, obviously it was not possible for any material substance of this world to reach the other
            side. So
            the Guru enlightened the people and asked them to worship One God, the Formless.</p>
        <p class="black"><a name="2" id="2"><strong>GURU TO KAMRUP</strong></a><br/>
            After Gaya he passed through the area where modern city of Patna stands and reached Hajipur. Passing through
            Kantnagar he reached Malda. The town of Malda was situated at the confluence of rivers Ganges and Mahanadi.
            It is
            reported that a local merchant of Malda did a great service to the Guru for which he received Guru's
            blessings. The
            next stop was Dhubri in Assam. After Dhubri he proceeded along the Brahmputra river on to Kamrup, a place
            near the
            modern city of Gauhati. This whole route is marked by many old historical Gurdwaras bearing association with
            the
            Guru.<br/>
            <br/>
            The city of Kamrup was ruled by a woman of black magic. She had assumed the name of Nurshah, the name of one
            from
            whom she had learnt this art. She and her female companions practiced black magic and exorcised strange
            powers in
            that locality. She owned the whole country around and many a mystic, yogi etc. fell prey to her magical
            schemes.<br/>
            <br/>
            The Guru stayed under a tree outside the city while Mardana went into the city to get something to eat. On
            his way
            he met some women and fell victim to their machination, who made a lamb of him. Under mesmeric influence
            Mardana did
            all what they commanded him to do. He was thus imprisoned by the witchcraft of Nurshah and could not return
            to the
            Guru. The Guru knew what had happened to his minstreland he started to rescue him from his captors. Nurshah
            saw the
            Guru coming and tried to captivate him with her charms but her art of magic failed. She found out that her
            spells
            were of no avail. On their fruitless efforts, the Guru uttered the following Sabad on Kuchaji or the woman
            of bad
            character:<br/>
            <br/>
            <em>&quot;I am a worthless woman; in me are faults; how can I go to<br/>
                <br/>
                enjoy my spouse?<br/>
                <br/>
                My spouse's wives are one better than the other; O my life,<br/>
                <br/>
                who careth for me?<br/>
                <br/>
                My female friends who have enjoyed their Spouse are in the<br/>
                <br/>
                shade of the mango.<br/>
                <br/>
                I do not possess their virtues; to whom can I attribute<br/>
                <br/>
                blame?<br/>
                <br/>
                What attributes of Thine, O Lord, shall I blazon abroad?<br/>
                <br/>
                What names of Thine shall I repeat?<br/>
                <br/>
                I cannot even attain one of Thy many excellences: I am ever<br/>
                <br/>
                a sacrifice unto Thee.<br/>
                <br/>
                Gold, silver, pearls, and rubies which gladden the heart-<br/>
                <br/>
                These things the Bridegroom hath given me, and I have fixed<br/>
                <br/>
                my heart on them.<br/>
                <br/>
                I had palaces of brick fashioned with marble.<br/>
                <br/>
                In these luxuries I forgot the Bridegroom and sat not near<br/>
                <br/>
                Him.<br/>
                <br/>
                The Kulangs cry in the heavens, and the cranes have come to<br/>
                <br/>
                roost.<br/>
                <br/>
                The woman goeth to her father-in-law's; how shall she show<br/>
                <br/>
                her face as she proceedeth?<br/>
                <br/>
                As morning dawned she soundly slept, and forgot her<br/>
                <br/>
                journey.<br/>
                <br/>
                She separated from Thee, O Spouse, and therefore stored up<br/>
                <br/>
                grief for herself.<br/>
                <br/>
                In Thee, O Lord, are merits; in me all demerits: Nanak hath<br/>
                <br/>
                this one representation to make,<br/>
                <br/>
                Every night is for the virtuous woman; may I though<br/>
                <br/>
                unchaste obtain a night also.&quot; (Rag Suhi Mohalla 1, p-762)<br/>
                <br/>
                The Guru also uttered the following Sabad on this occasion:<br/>
                <br/>
                &nbsp;&quot;In words we are good, but in acts bad.<br/>
                <br/>
                We are impure-minded and black-hearted, yet we wear the<br/>
                <br/>
                white robes of innocence.<br/>
                <br/>
                We envy those who stand and serve at His gate.<br/>
                <br/>
                They who love the Bridegroom and enjoy the pleasure of His<br/>
                <br/>
                embraces,<br/>
                <br/>
                Are lowly even in their strength, and remain humble.<br/>
                <br/>
                Nanak, our lives shall be profitable if we meet such women.&quot; (Sri Rag ki Var Mohalla
                1,2-7,p-85)<br/>
                <br/>
                After the Guru uttered these Sabads, Nurshah thought that she would tempt him with wealth. Her
                attendants
                brought pearls, diamonds, gold, silver and laid down before him. She then prayed,&quot;O great magician,
                accept
                me as thy disciple and teach me thy magic.&quot; The Guru rejected all the presents and uttered the
                following
                Sabad:<br/>
                <br/>
                &quot;O silly woman, why art thou proud?<br/>
                <br/>
                Why enjoyest thou not the love of God in thine own home?<br/>
                <br/>
                The Spouse is near; O foolish woman, why searchest thou<br/>
                <br/>
                abroad?<br/>
                <br/>
                Put surma needles of God's fear into thine eyes, and wear the<br/>
                <br/>
                decoration of love.<br/>
                <br/>
                Thou shalt be known as a devoted happy wife if thou love<br/>
                <br/>
                the Bridegroom.<br/>
                <br/>
                What shall a silly woman do if she please not her Spouse?<br/>
                <br/>
                However much she implore, she may not enter His chamber.<br/>
                <br/>
                Without God's grace she obtaineth nothing, howsoever she<br/>
                <br/>
                may strive.<br/>
                <br/>
                Intoxicated with avarice, covetousness, and pride, she<br/>
                <br/>
                is absorbed in mammon.<br/>
                <br/>
                It is not by these means the Bridegroom is obtained; silly<br/>
                <br/>
                is the woman who thinketh so.<br/>
                <br/>
                Go and ask the happy wives by what means they obtained<br/>
                <br/>
                their Spouse-<br/>
                <br/>
                'Whatever He doeth accept as good; have done with<br/>
                <br/>
                cleverness and orders,<br/>
                <br/>
                Apply thy mind to the worship of His feet by whose love<br/>
                <br/>
                what is most valued is obtained.<br/>
                <br/>
                Do whatever the Bridegroom biddeth thee; give Him the<br/>
                <br/>
                body and soul; such perfumes apply.'<br/>
                <br/>
                Thus speak the happy wives: 'O sister, by these means the<br/>
                <br/>
                Spouse is obtained.<br/>
                <br/>
                Efface thyself, so shalt thou obtain the Bridegroom; what<br/>
                <br/>
                other art is there?'<br/>
                <br/>
                Only that day is of account when the Bridegroom looketh<br/>
                <br/>
                with favor; the wife hath then obtained the wealth of<br/>
                <br/>
                the world.<br/>
                <br/>
                &nbsp;So who pleaseth her Spouse is the happy wife; Nanak, she is<br/>
                <br/>
                the queen of them all.<br/>
                <br/>
                She is saturated with pleasure, intoxicated with happiness,<br/>
                <br/>
                and day and night absorbed in His love.<br/>
                <br/>
                She is beautiful and fair to view, accomplished, and it is<br/>
                <br/>
                she alone who is wise.&quot; (Tilang Mohalla 1, p-722)<br/>
            </em><em><br/>
            </em> On hearing this Sabad, Nurshah and her companions fell at the feet of the Guru and asked for
            forgiveness and
            blessing to obtain salvation. The Guru told them to repeat God's Name conscientiously, perform their
            domestic
            duties, renounce magic and thus they would secure salvation. It is said that they became Guru's followers.
            After a
            short stay he departed leaving behind the awakened souls,to carry on his Divine mission</p>
