        <p><strong><a name="1" id="1">THIRD BATTLE OF ANANDPUR:</a></strong></p>
        <p class="black">At that time there were only 800 Sikhs in the Guru's army at Anandpur. Raja Ajmer Chand summoned his allies,
            Rajas of
            Handur, Chamba and Fatehpur with the object of chastising the Guru. They all expressed themselves in favor
            of
            immediate measures and attacked the Guru's forces at Anandpur. In the previous battles of Anandpur the Sikhs
            had
            mostly remained behind their battlements but they met the enemy this time in the open field outside
            Anandpur. The
            Sikhs fought with their usual courage and determination. The hill chiefs could not achieve any success and
            retired
            from the battle in despair. This battle was fought in 1703.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><a name="2" id="2">FOURTH BATTLE OF ANANDPUR:</a></strong></p>
        <p class="black">Owing to the repeated representations of the hill chiefs, the Emperor sent a large army under the command of
            General
            Saiyad Khan to subdue the Guru. Saiyad Khan was a brother-in-law of Pir Budhu Shah ofSadhaura who ought on
            the side
            of the Guru at the battle of Bhangani. On his way to Anandpur Saiyad</p>
        <p class="black">Khan met Pir Budhu Shah and heard all favorable accounts of the Guru and, thus, had a wish to behold him. It
            was the
            end of March, 1704 and was a crop-cutting time of the year, so the majority of the Guru's Sikhs had
            dispersed to
            their homes. There were only five hundred strong troops left at Anandpur at that time. The Guru had to make
            best
            defence with the present force. Maimun Khan, a faithful Mohammadan who had attached himself to the Guru,
            asked his
            permission to show his bravery. The brave and faithful Saiyad Beg also came forward to render his services.
            Both
            Musalmans fought like tigers in the battle, and were followed by the Sikhs.</p>
        <p class="black">The Sikhs advanced boldly against the enemy. Saiyad Beg entered into a single combat with Raja Hari Chand.
            After they
            had repeatedly missed each other, Saiyad Beg at last struck off the hill chief's head. Onseeing this Din eg
            of the
            imperial army rushed at Saiyad Beg and mortally wounded him. Maimun Khan from horseback charged in every
            direction
            and committed great havoc among the imperial troops. The Guru knew what was passing in General Saiyad Khan's
            mind,
            and advanced ostensibly to challenge him. Saiyad Khan on obtaining the wish of his heart to behold the Guru,
            dismounted and fell at his feet. The Guru conferred on him the true Name. After Saiyad Khan's defection,
            Ramzan Khan
            took command and fought with great bravery against the Sikhs. The Guru shot an arrow which killed Ramzan
            Khan's
            horse. The Sikhs rallied and presented a bold front to the enemy but being too few in number were
            overpowered by
            them. When the Guru saw that there was no chance of retrieving his position, he decided to evacuate
            Anandpur. The
            Mohammadan army plundered the city. After obtaining this booty they proceeded back to Sirhind. When the
            imperial
            army was resting at night, the Sikhs made a sudden attack, which created great confusion in the enemy camp.
            The
            Turks who turned to oppose the Sikhs, were killed and only those who fled, escaped the vengeance of the
            Guru's
            pursuing army. The Sikhs also deprived them of all the booty they had captured at Anandpur. After this the
            Guru
            returned and took possession of Anandpur.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><a name="3" id="3">FIFTH BATTLE OF ANANDPUR:</a></strong></p>
        <p class="black">The Emperor called on his troops to account for their cowardice. They pleaded that the Sikhs had taken an
            unfair
            advantage of their position in the battle field. At one point the Emperor asked what sort of person the Guru
            was and
            what force he possessed. A Mohammadan soldier gave highly colored accounts of the Guru's beauty, sanctity
            and
            prowess. He described him as a young handsome man, a living saint, the father of his people and in war equal
            to one
            hundred twenty-five thousand men. The Emperor was much displeased on hearing this elaborate praise of the
            Guru and
            ordered that he should be brought to his presence. In the meantime Raja Ajmer Chand made a strong
            representation to
            the Emperor for assistance to bring the Guru to submission. Accordingly the viceroys of Sirhind, Lahore and
            Kashmir
            were ordered to proceed against the Guru.</p>
        <p class="black">Some faithful Sikhs informed the Guru of war preparations as a result of Raja Ajmer Chand's representationto
            the
            Emperor. The Guru made arrangements accordingly and sent for his followers. The Sikhs of Majha, Malwa and
            Doaba and
            other places thronged to Anandpur. They were delighted at the prospect of battle, and congratulated
            themselves on
            their good fortune in being allowed to die for their Guru and their faith. The Guru affirmed that the death
            in the
            battle-field in the name of religion was equal to the fruits of many years' devotion, and ensured honor and
            glory in
            the next world.</p>
        <p class="black">The noteworthy point in this whole episode is that the Guru having won battle after battle, never captured an
            inch of
            territory, never nurtured enmity, and never attacked anybody as an aggressor. By the creation of the Khalsa
            he
            established equality and brotherhood of mankind. The down-trodden segments of the society which were ever
            ridiculed
            by the so called high caste Brahmans and Khatris, had now become undaunted saint-soldiers after being
            baptized by
            the Guru and joining the brotherhood of the Khalsa. The Brahmans and the hill chiefs considered all this a
            threat to
            their very existence. They were, therefore, waging a constant war against the Guru and his Sikhs.</p>
        <p class="black">The hill chiefs who arrayed themselves against the Guru were Raja Ajmer Chand of Kahlur, Rajas of Kangra,
            Kullu,
            Kionthal, Mandi, Jammu, Nurpur, Chamba, Guler, Garhwal, Bijharwal, Darauli and Dadhwal. They were joined by
            the
            Gujars and the Ranghars of the area, and all of them formed a formidable force. The imperial army of the
            viceroys'
            of Sirhind, Lahore and Kashmir came in large number. The chronicler judiciously remarks that the Khalsa must
            be
            congratulated because, though few in number, having the blessings of their Guru they had confidence in
            themselves to
            fight for their religion, and delighted in anticipation of the approaching conflict. It is recorded that
            there were
            ten thousand Sikhs at Anandpur while the opposing army came as strong as fifteen to twenty times in number
            than the
            Sikhs.</p>

        <p>The allied forces fell on Anandpur like locust. On seeing this the Guru ordered his artillery men to
            discharge their
            cannon into the hostile army at the thickest spot. The enemy made a charge to seize the artillery, but were
            quickly
            restrained by the fatal accuracy with which the Sikhs served their guns. They were supported by the
            infantry. The
            city of Anandpur was on a little higher elevation and the allied forces were in the open and had no
            protection, and
            consequently fell in heaps. A fierce battle was fought for a few days. The Mohammadan gunners were promised
            large
            reward if they killed the Guru but they were unsuccessful in their mission because their gun fire was either
            high or
            too low and could not hit the target. The allied army finding their guns useless tried hand to hand fight.
            On seeing
            this the Guru began to discharge his arrows with marvelous effect. The fearful carnage continued, horses
            fell on
            horses, men on men. The allied forces rallied a strong effort to conquer, but was so vigorously and
            successfully
            repulsed that they were obliged to uspend hostilities at the end of each day of warfare. The Mohammadans and
            the
            hill chiefs had different opinions as to the cause of the success of the Sikhs. Some thought that the Guru
            had
            supreme miraculous power and the supernatural forces fought on his side. Others maintained that the Guru's
            success
            was owing to the fact that his men were protected behind their ramparts. While this discussion was going on,
            the
            Mohammadan viceroys decided to storm the fortress where the Guru was stationed. On seeing this the Sikhs put
            their
            two guns called Baghan (tigress) and Bijai-ghosh (sound of victory) in position. The aims were taken at the
            enemy.
            The tents were blown away and great havoc was caused. On seeing this the Mohammadan viceroys retreated and
            the hill
            armies fled. That evening the Guru offered thanksgiving, and beat the drum of victory.</p>
        <p class="black">Having failed through dire ct assault, the allied army planned a siege of the city of Anandpur in such a
            waythat all
            entrances and exits for both goods and persons were completely closed. They completely besieged the city,
            and the
            Guru's supplies were failing. Food position became extremely serious and the Sikhs were driven to undertake
            some
            dangerous expeditions. They went out at night to snatch provisions from the besiegers. After some time the
            allies
            collected their stores at one place and guarded them day and night. When the enemy learnt about the
            distressful
            situation of the Sikhs, they planned a different strategy to induce the Guru to leave Anandpur. Raja Ajmer
            Chand
            sent his envoy to him saying that if he left Anandpur, their armies would withdraw and he could afterwards
            return
            whenever he pleased. The Guru did not pay any heed to this proposal. The offer was repeated several times,
            but the
            Guru did not accept it. Having suffered extreme hardships, the Sikhs besought the Guru to evacuate the fort,
            but the
            Guru counselled them patience for some time more. The Sikhs who heard enemy's proposal, went to the Guru's
            mother to
            use her influence on him. She pleaded with him but in vain. The Guru told her that the enemy's proposal was
            hypocritical since they planned to draw out the Sikhs from within the shelter of the city and attack them.
            Some of
            the Masands and the Sikhs who were influenced by the hill chiefs, insisted that the proposal of the enemy be
            accepted and the city be abandoned. Some Sikhs became impatient and</p>
        <p class="black">Dish eartened. The Guru asked them to declare their allegiance. Forty of them signed a disclaimer saying that
            the was
            not their Guru and they were not his Sikhs. After they signed the disclaimer, they were allowed by the Guru
            to go
            away. He then brought out a scheme to expose the hypocrisy of the enemy.</p>
        <p class="black">The Guru sent for Raja Ajmer Chand's envoy and told him that he would evacuate Anandpur if the allied armies
            would
            first allow the removal of his treasure and property. The Hindus swore on the Salgram (their idol) and the
            Mohammadans on the holy Quran, that they would not deceive or molest his servants departing with his
            property. The
            Guru then immediately ordered a number of cartloads of useless articles. To the bullocks' horns were
            attached
            torches and at the dead of night, the caravan of bullocks with their loads, started along with some Sikhs
            accompanying them. When the caravan reached the enemy lines they forgot all their pledges and fell upon the
            small
            company of the Sikhs to loot the treasure. Their disappointment was great when they found out that the
            treasure was
            made up of rubbish articles. In this way the Guru exposed the treachery of the enemy and told his Sikhs that
            everything they had endured had been by the Will of God, and he quoted Guru Nanak- &quot;Happiness is a
            disease, the
            remedy for which is unhappiness&quot;.</p>
        <p class="black">At last came an autographed letter from the Emperor to the Guru- &quot;I have sworn on the Quran not to harm.
            You. If
            I do, may I not find a place in God's court hereafter! Cease warfare and come to me. If you do notdesire to
            come
            hither, then go whithersoever you please.&quot; The Emperor's envoy added that the Emperor promised that he
            would
            not harm the Guru. The hill Rajas also swore by the cow and called their idols to witness, that they would
            allow
            safe passage to the Guru. The Guru told the enemy,&quot; You are all liars, and therefore all your empire
            and your
            glory shall depart. You all took oaths before and then perjured yourselves.&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">The Sikhs went again to the Guru's mother to complain of his refusal to listen to reason. He, however, felt
            that
            their pleading was not reasonable but it was not appropriate to accept the terms of the enemy and leave the
            fort.
            The Sikhs stricken with hunger, supported the envoy's representation. The Guru comforted them,&quot; My
            brethren,
            waver not, I only desire your welfare. You know not that these people are deceivers and design to do us
            evil. If you
            hold a little longer, you shall have food to your heart's content.&quot; When the Sikhs refused to wait any
            longer,
            he asked them to wait only a few days more when the great God would send them relief. The Sikhs, however,
            refused to
            wait even for a day. The Guru repeated his request saying that the enemy would then retire and they would
            all be
            happy. He also warned the Sikhs,&quot; O dear Khalsa, you are rushing to your destruction, while I am
            endeavoring to
            save you.&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">The Sikhs were so much hunger stricken that they refused to stay even for a day. The Guru's mother was also
            in favor
            of evacuating the fort. The allied armies sent a Saiyid (a Mohammadan priest) and a Brahman, both of whom
            were to
            swear, on behalf of the allied armies, solemn oaths of safe conduct for the Guru should he evacuate
            Anandpur. On
            seeing this the Sikhs began to waver in their allegiance to the Guru, and in the end only forty Sikhs
            decided to
            remain with him and share his fortunes. He told them that they too might desert him. They refused and said
            that they
            would either remain within the fort or force their way out as the Guru directed. He knew that the seed of
            his
            religion would flourish. He then finally decided to leave Anandpur and gave orders to his men that they all
            were to
            march at night. Anandpur was finally evacuated on 6-7 Poh, Sambat 1762 (20-21 December, 1705).</p>
        <p class="black">Bhai Daya Singh and Ude Singh walked in front of the Guru, Mohkam Singh and Sahib Singh on his right, the
            second
            batch of baptized Sikhs on his left. His sons Ajit Singh and Jujhar Singh followed with bows and arrows.
            Then came
            Bhai Himmat Singh carrying ammunition and matchlocks. Gulab Rai, Sham Singh and other Sikhs and relations
            accompanied him. The rest of the followers brought up the rear, about five hundred in all. The moment the
            enemy got
            the news of Guru's departure, they again forgot all about their pledges and set out in hot pursuit
            immediately.
            Skirmishes started from Kiratpur onwards. Realizing the impending danger the Guru charged Ude Singh with the
            responsibility to check the advance of the enemy. Bhai Ude Singh fought a bloody battle at Shahi Tibbi. The
            enemy
            surrounded and killed the dauntless and the bravest of the Guru's brave warriors, Ude Singh. When the battle
            of
            Shahi Tibbi was in progress, the Guru had reached the bank of Sarsa river. At that time a news came that a
            contingent of enemy troops was fast approaching. Bhai Jiwan Singh, a Rangretta Sikh, was given a band of one
            hundred
            warriors to encounter the pursuers. With the rest of his people the Guru plunged into the flooded waters of
            the
            Sarsa river. The flood was so strong that many were drowned and many were scattered in different directions
            including the Guru's mother with two younger sons, Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh. Besides, there was a heavy
            loss of
            valuable literature and property. The Guru accompanying his two eldest sons and some veteran Sikhs reached
            the
            village Ghanaula on the other side of Sarsa river. Apprehending that the route ahead might be beset with
            danger, the
            Guru gave Bhai Bachitar Singh a band of one hundred Sikhs and instructed him to march by the direct route to
            Rupar,
            whereas he with some veteran Sikhs preferred to take a longer route and reached Kotla Nihang near Rupar to
            stay with
            Pathan Nihang Khan who was an old and sincere devotee of the Sikh Gurus. Bhai Bachitar Singh and his men had
            to
            fight their way through a cordon of the Ranghars of Malikpur, a village near Rupar, and the Pathans of
            Rupar. During
            the fierce fighting that took place on this occasion, majority of the Sikhs fell dead and Bachitar Singh was
            mortally wounded.</p>
        <p class="black">The Guru did not stay long at Kotla Nihang. It seems that he was to proceed to Machhiwara and Rai Kot.
            Accompanied by
            his two eldest sons and forty Sikhs, the Guru halted at Bur Majra after Kotla Nihang. A news was received
            that a
            large body of Sirhind troops was chasing them. Immediately the Guru decided to face the enemy from within
            the Garhi
            of Chamkaur and he hurried towards it. He was well aware of the importance of this Garhi (mud fortress) as
            he had,
            on a previous occasion, fought a battle at this place.</p>

        <p>The imperial army which was in hot pursuit, besieged the fortress. They were joined by the hill chiefs and
            the
            Ranghars and the Gujars. The Guru appointed eight men to guard each of the four walls. Two Sikhs held the
            door and
            other two were appointed sentinels. The Guru himself, his two sons; and Daya Singh and Sant Singh went on
            the top
            storey. The Sikhs held the fortress for a long time against the heavy odds. Nahar Khan and Ghairat Khan, the
            two
            imperial officers, attempted to scale the little fort, but were shot down by the Guru. After that none of
            the
            Mohammadan officers dared to attempt the fatal ascent. Five Sikhs went forth to contend with the enemy.
            After
            fighting with great bravery, they were killed. They continued in batches of five. Guru's eldest son, Ajit
            Singh
            (about 18 years old) asked permission to go forth and fight the enemy. The Guru approved the proposal and
            Ajit Singh
            went with five Sikh heroes. He performed prodigies of valor and ultimately fell, fighting bravely along with
            his
            companions. On seeing his brother's fate, Jujhar Singh (14 years old) could not restrain himself and asked
            his
            father's permission. Like his elder brother, Jujhar Singh went in the battle field, but after a little while
            he
            turned back and asked for water. The Guru shouted,&quot; Go back, there is no more water left for you on
            this earth.
            See yonder, Ajit Singh is holding the cup of nectar for you.&quot; Jujhar Singh went back and created havoc
            upon the
            enemy and fell fighting valiantly. Upon this the Guru's face was jubilant. His expression of mental
            composure showed
            glow of divinity upon the glorious end of his sons. After the sons had achieved their splendid mission, the
            Guru
            then got ready to go out and fight. The remaining few Sikhs fell on their knees before him and entreated him
            not
            togo. At that moment their victory lay in saving the Guru. If he lived, they argued, he would create
            millions like
            them. They therefore, persuaded the Guru to leave the place but he would not listen to them. At that point
            Bhai Daya
            Singh who was the first of the Five Beloved Ones, recalled that at the time of creation of the Khalsa, the
            Guru had
            promised that the mandate of the Five Beloved Sikhs would be binding even upon the Guru. Upon this Bhai Daya
            Singh
            took four other Sikhs and formed an assembly which passed a 'Gurmata' (resolution) and said,&quot; O true
            king, the
            Khalsa now orders you to leave this place.&quot; As promised at the time of administering Amrit to the Five
            Beloved
            Ones, the wonderful supreme lord Guru Gobind Singh submitted before the Khalsa and accepted their verdict to
            leave
            the Garhi (fortress).</p>
        <p class="black">Sant Singh and Sangat Singh offered to remain in the fort while Daya Singh, Dharam Singh, and Man Singh were
            determined to accompany the Guru. It is said that Sant Singh very much resembled the Guru. Therefore he gave
            his
            plume to Sant Singh, clothed him in his armor and seated him in the upper room where Guru was stationed. He
            and
            three of his companions escaped during the night. He told them that if per chance they were separated from
            him, they
            were to go in the direction of a particular star which he showed to them. It was a cold night of December
            and the
            allied armies were resting in their tents. The Guru decided to awaken the enemy, lest they should think that
            he
            absconded. He discharged two arrows on the Turkish sentries. The arrows first struck torches which they held
            in
            their hands and then they passed through their bodies. In the darkness which followed the extinction of the
            torches,
            the Guru and his three companions escaped. A little far outside, he clapped his hands and shouted aloud that
            he was
            leaving if any one wanted to capture him, should try.</p>
        <p class="black">When he was escaping, he bade his men to stand firm. The Sikhs who were left behind, inflicted great loss on
            the
            enemy. The Mohammadans at last were able to scale the building and they believed that they were going to
            capture the
            Guru. They were greatly disappointed to subsequently learn that the person who was wearing plume and armor,
            was not
            the Guru but he was Sant Singh, and that the Guru had escaped. The allied armies retreated to their
            respectable
            places. Wazir Khan sent orders in all directions of his areas that any one who offered aid to the Guru,
            would be
            severely punished, and the one who captured him or gave his whereabouts would be greatly rewarded.</p>

        <p>After leaving the Garhi, he proceeded barefooted on his journey alone and after passing through Jandsar and
            Behlolpur, he reached the thorny wilds of Machhiwara, a place between Rupar and Ludhiana. Thirst, hunger and
            fatigue
            overtook him. His feet were blistered. When he reached a garden he rested his head on a heap of earth and
            slept.
            While he was resting in the garden, his three companions, Daya Singh, Dharam Singh and Man Singh reached and
            rejoined him. The situation was very grave because the enemy was in hot pursuit of the Guru. Gulaba, an old
            Masand
            of Machhiwara, took him and his three companions to his home, but soon he got frightened and feared for his
            own
            safety if the Guru stayed with him. At this juncture two Pathan horse merchants, Nabi Khan and Ghani Khan,
            who were
            old acquaintances of the Guru, came and chose to risk their lives for the service of the Guru. There lived a
            Sikh
            woman in the village who had spun and weaved a cloth for the Guru and had vowed to keep it until his arrival
            in the
            village. The Guru had the cloth dyed blue and a robe was made from it in imitation of the attire of
            Mohammadan
            pilgrims. He wore the blue robe and then departed from Gulaba's village. He was carried in a litter by Nabi
            Khan and
            Ghani Khan in front, and Dharam Singh and Man Singh in rear, while Daya Singh waved a chauri over him. They
            told all
            inquirers that they were escorting Uch da Pir or a high priest. Since Nabi Khan and Ghani Khan were very
            famous
            horse merchants in the area, people believed them.</p>
        <p>From there they reached Ghangharali village and then Lal. At the village Lal which is about five miles from
            Doraha in
            Ludhiana district, a military officer had some doubts and he made searching inquiries. Pir Mohammad of
            Nurpur who
            was known to the Guru, was asked to identify the occupant of the litter. He confirmed that he was really Uch
            da Pir,
            upon which the officer let the Guru go. From Lal he visited Katana and then Kanoch where masand Fateh put
            him off
            with excuses and did not let him stay. From there he reached Alam Gir. Here Nand Lal, a Zamindar presented a
            horse
            to the Guru, thereby enabling him to change from litter to horse. The situation became easier and the Guru
            asked
            Nabi Khan and Ghani Khan to return home, after giving them a letter of appreciation (Hukam Nama)
            recommending them
            for the consideration of the faithful. Pir Mohammad was also honored with such a letter of appreciation.
            From Alam
            Gir he advanced on horse back in the direction of Rai Kot. At Silaoni the chief of Rai Kot, Rai Kalla who
            was Guru's
            devotee and a close relative of Nihang Khan of Kotla Nihang, waited upon him and took him to Rai Kot. Here
            Nura Mahi
            brought the news from Sirhind about Guru's younger sons.</p>
