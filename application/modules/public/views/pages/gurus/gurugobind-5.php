        <h2 class="no-top">Sri Guru Gobind Singh Sahib Ji</h2>
        <p><strong><a name="1" id="1">BHAI JOGA SINGH:</a></strong></p>
        <p class="black">From the early youth Joga Singh was living at the Guru's Darbar and was a great devotee. One day Guru's eye
            caught
            him and he asked what his name was. He replied,&quot; O true king, my name is Joga Singh.&quot; The Guru
            asked,&quot;
            Whose Joga you are?&quot; (Joga means for whose service he is fit or simply for whom he is?) &quot;I am Guru
            Joga (I
            am in the service of the Guru),&quot; replied Joga Singh. Upon this the Guru promised,&quot; If you are Guru
            Joga,
            then Guru is tere Joga ( then the Guru is for you).&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">After sometimes Joga Singh went to his home in Peshawar for his marriage. When the marriage ceremony was
            half-way
            through, a man arrived with an urgent message from the Guru to him to proceed to Anandpur without delay.
            Joga Singh
            read the command and instantly left for Anandpur without completing the marriage ceremony. He obeyed Guru's
            order
            over everything else. Indeed the path of the devotees is sharper than the edge of a razor blade, and it is
            even
            narrower than the hair-breadth on which they have to tread.</p>
        <p class="black">Joga Singh continued his journey to Anandpur as fast as he could. After passing through Lahore and Amritsar,
            he
            reached a resting spot at Hoshiarpur. On his way his ego got inflated and he thought,&quot; Who could have
            acted
            like me? Certainly very few Sikhs would carry out the Guru's order like me.&quot; This sense of pride
            brought his
            fall. At night he was overwhelmed by evil-passion and he started towards the house of a prostitute. Joga
            Singh was
            wearing Guru's uniform- a turban and beard. On his way to the prostitute, Joga Singh talked to himself,&quot;
            If
            some one sees me going into the house of a prostitute, it will bring disgrace to the Guru. Outwardly I am in
            Guru's
            attire. So nobody should see me entering the prostitute's house.&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">As soon as he reached near the house of the prostitute, a watchman appeared saying aloud,&quot; Be aware
            fellows!&quot;
            Joga Singh could not enter the house and he walked on to the next street. Looking around and thinking that
            the
            watchman might have left, he hurried towards the house of the prostitute again. To his amazement the
            watchman
            reappeared shouting,&quot; Be aware fellows!&quot; Joga Singh could not afford to be seen by anybody going
            into the
            house of the prostitute, knowing in his heart that it would bring slur to Guru's name since he was in Guru's
            uniform. Finally he quit his evil act after trying a few times without success.</p>
        <p class="black">Next morning he started his journey and reached Anandpur. Joga Singh stood mute before the Guru with his head
            down.
            The Guru asked him about the well-being of himself and his family but Joga Singh stood mute. The divine
            Master then
            addressed him,&quot; Joga Singh, do you remember when you said that you were Guru Joga, and the Guru had
            promised,
            if you were Guru Joga, then Guru tere Joga.&quot; Upon this the Guru further explained,&quot;In the garb of
            a
            watchman I guarded you in the streets of Hoshiarpur last night, against the sinful deeds and thus saved you
            from
            disgrace.&quot; Joga Singh fell on Guru's feet and asked for forgiveness.</p>
        <p>Such are the ways of the Master. Once we put our complete faith in him, he does not abandon us. The Guru
            confirms:</p>
        <p>&quot;As long as the Khalsa remain distinct and intact, I shall bless them in every way; When they
            detract</p>
        <p>from the prescribed path, I detest them for ever.&quot;</p>
        <p>(Guru Gobind Singh)</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><a name="2" id="2">POST-KHALSA PERIOD ACTIVITIES:</a></strong></p>
        <p class="black">The hill Rajas including the Raja of Kahlur came to visit the Guru and had a good deal of discussion about
            the pros
            and cons of the Khalsa. He advised them to embrace the Khalsa religion in order to elevate the fallen
            condition of
            their country. The hill Rajas took their departure without accepting the Guru's proposal to accept Khalsa
            creed.</p>
        <p class="black">The immediate effect of the creation of the Khalsa was the anxiety of the hill Rajas who considered the
            Guru's
            activities as a potent threat to their own religion and state power. The Guru asked his Sikhs, wherever they
            resided, to come to Anandpur and accept baptism, thus, become members of the Khalsa. They started coming in
            large
            numbers to pay homage to him and get baptized. This growing number of the baptized Sikhs, surcharged with
            their
            spirit of equality, and disengaged from the orthodox way of living, who seemed to be always ready to combat
            evil,
            alarmed the hill Rajas who considered it a direct challenge to their feudal order and their orthodox way of
            living.</p>
        <p class="black">One day the Guru went on a hunting excursion in the Dun when Balia Chand and Alim Chand, two hill chiefs made
            a
            surprise attack on his party. There were only a few Sikhs with the Guru. Both sides fought desperately. Alim
            Chand
            aimed a blow of his sword at Alim Singh, who received it on his shield and then with his return blow struck
            off Alim
            Chand's right arm. He managed to escape and left Balia Chand in sole command of the troops. However Balia
            Chand was
            soon shot dead by Ude Singh. The hill troops, having found one of their chiefs dead and the other having
            fled,
            abandoned the battle field leaving the Guru's party victorious.</p>

        <p><strong><a name="3" id="3">FIRST BATTLE OF ANANDPUR:</a></strong></p>

        <p>After this defeat, the hill Rajas thought it highly dangerous to allow the Sikhs to increase in power and
            number.
            They therefore, decided collectively to complain to the Delhi government against the Sikhs. Aurangzeb was
            still busy
            in the south. The viceroy of Delhi sent General Din Beg and General Painde Khan each with five thousand men
            to
            resist the Guru's encroachments on the rights of the hill Rajas. When the imperial forces reached Rupar,
            they were
            joined by hill Rajas.</p>
        <p>The Guru appointed the Five Beloved Ones as generals of his army. The Sikh chronicler states that, when the
            engagement began at Anandpur, the Turks were roasted by the continuous and deadly fire of the Sikhs. General
            Painde
            Khan seeing determined resistance of the Sikhs, shouted to his men to fight to the death against the
            infidels. He
            came forward to engage in a single combat with the Guru and invited him to strike the first blow. The Guru
            refused
            the role of an aggressor and claimed that he had vowed never to strike except in self-defence. Upon this
            Painde Khan
            discharged an arrow which whizzed past Guru's ear. He charged another arrow which also missed the mark. The
            whole of
            Painde Khan's body except his ears was encased in armour. Knowing this the Guru then discharged an arrow at
            his ear
            with such an unerring aim that he fell off his horse on the ground and never rose again. This, however, did
            not end
            the battle. Din Beg assumed sole command of the troops. Maddened by Painde Khan's death they fought with
            great
            desperation but could not make any impression on the firm hold of the Sikhs. On the other hand, however, the
            Sikhs
            caused a great havoc upon the enemy. The hill chiefs left the field. In the meantime Din Beg was wounded and
            he beat
            a retreat but was pursued by the Sikhs as far as Rupar (upto the village of Khidrabad near Chandigarh where
            there is
            a Gurdwara in that memory). This battle was fought in the beginning of 1701.</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong><a name="4" id="4">SECOND BATTLE OF ANANDPUR:</a></strong></p>
        <p class="black">The Rajas of Jammu, Nurpur, Mandi, Bhutan, Kullu, Kionthal, Guler, Chamba, Srinagar, Dadhwal, Handur and
            others,
            assembled at Bilaspur to discuss the newly created situation. Raja Ajmer Chand of Kahlur (son of late Raja
            Bhim
            Chand) addressed them that if they overlooked the growing power of the Guru, he would one day drive them out
            from
            their territories. On the other hand if they were to seek assistance from Delhi again and again, they might
            be taken
            over by the Mughal empire for ever. It was, therefore, decided that they must defend themselves. If all the
            hill
            Rajas contributed reasonable contingents, they could muster a large army which would be sufficient to
            annihilate the
            Guru and his Sikhs. Thus a simple and feasible measure was thought out to invest the Guru's capital,
            Anandpur, and
            starve its occupants into submission.</p>
        <p class="black">Accordingly all the Rajas brought their contingents and marched towards Anandpur. On arriving near thecity
            they
            dispatched a letter to the Guru in which they wrote,&quot; The land of Anandpur is ours, we allowed your
            father to
            dwell on it and he never paid any rent. Now you have originated a new religion which is opposed to our
            religious
            system. We have endured all this up to the present, we can no longer overlook it. You should pay the arrears
            of rent
            for the occupation of our land and promise to pay it regularly for the future. If you fail to accept these
            terms,
            then prepare your departure from Anandpur or be ready for the consequences.&quot; The Guru replied,&quot; My
            father
            had purchased this land and he paid for it. If you deprive me of Anandpur, you shall have it with bullets
            added
            thereto. Seek my protection, and you will be happy in both worlds. Also seek the protection of the Khalsa
            and
            abandon pride. Now is the time for a settlement. I shall act as a mediator between the Khalsa and you. You
            may then
            rule your states without apprehension.&quot;</p>
        <p class="black">It was now clear to the Rajas that the Guru would not surrender. Next morning they beat the drum of war.As
            anticipated a large number of Ranghars and Gujars under the command of Jagatullah flocked to the side of the
            hill
            Rajas.</p>
        <p class="black">Five hundred men from the Majha area arrived under the command of Duni Chand to join the Guru's forces, and
            ther
            reinforcements from other quarters also arrived at that juncture. There were two main forts, Lohgarh and
            Fatehgarh.
            The Guru ordered his forces not to advance beyond the city but remain as far as possible on the defensive.
            Sher
            Singh and Nahar Singh were appointed as chiefs to guard Lohgarh, and Fatehgarh was entrusted to Ude Singh.
            Sahibzada
            Ajit Singh, Guru's eldest son, asked his father's permission to join hands with Ude Singh.</p>
        <p class="black">The hill Rajas opened fire with large guns on the Guru's fortress. Several brave Sikhs made a determined
            stand
            against the enemy and forced them to retreat. The allied chiefs then held a brief council of war in which it
            was
            decided to despatch Raja Kesari Chand, the haughty chief of Jaswal, to attack the right flank and Jagatullah
            the
            left flank of the Guru's position while Ajmer Chand himself and his troops made a front attack on Anandpur.
            Jagatullah was shot dead by Sahib Singh and the Sikhs did not retreat to allow the enemy to remove his body.
            Raja
            Ghumand Chand of Kangra rallied his troops but failed to cause the Sikhs to retreat. The hill chiefs were in
            great
            dismay at the result of the battle and held a council of war during the night. Raja Ajmer Chand advised the
            council
            for peace with the Guru saying that the Guru occupied Guru Nanak's spiritual throne and there would be no
            indignity
            in appealing to him as supplicants. Many Rajas agreed to the proposal but Kesari Chand of Jaswal opposed the
            reconciliation and promised to fight with more determination the next day in order to oust the Guru from
            Anandpur.</p>

        <p class="black">Next morning the allied forces contented themselves with concentrating their attack on one particular part of
            the
            city but the Sikhs again offered valiant resistance. The allied forces rallied many times but could not
            overcome the
            brave Sikhs and so they decided to siege the city which lasted for a few weeks. As the blockade prolonged
            successfully, Raja Kesari Chand prepared to intoxicate an elephant and direct him against the city. Whole
            body of
            the elephant was encased in steel. A strong spear projected from his forehead for the purpose of assault.
            The
            intoxicated elephant was directed towards the gate of Lohgarh fort and the allied army followed him. The
            Guru
            blessed his Sikh, Vichitar Singh to combat the elephant. Vichitar Singh took a lance to meet the furious
            animal. He
            raised his lance and drove it through the elephant's head armor. On this the animal turned around on the
            hill
            soldiers, and killed several of them. Meanwhile Ude Singh continued to advance against Kesari Chand,
            challenged him,
            and then with one blow cut off his head. Mohkam Singh, one of the Five Beloved Ones, cut off the mad
            elephant's
            trunk with one blow of his sword. What remained of the hill army now fled. In the retreat the Raja of Handur
            was
            severely wounded by Sahib Singh.</p>
        <p class="black">On the following day Ghumand Chand of Kangra directed the efforts of his troops against the city. Ghumand
            Chand's
            horse was killed by a bullet from the musket of Alim Singh. The battle lasted with varying success until
            evening,
            when Ghumand Chand, as he was proceeding to his tent in the evening, was mortally wounded by a chance
            bullet. All
            the hill chiefs now became disheartened and demoralized. Raja Ajmer Chand was the last to leave Anandpur and
            marched
            home in the dead of night. This battle was fought in 1701.</p>
        <p><strong><a name="5" id="5">BATTLE OF NIRMOH:</a></strong></p>
        <p class="black">Ajmer Chand in spite of the defeat of the allied forces, determined to oust the Guru. He sent an envoy to the
            Emperor's viceroy in Sirhind and another envoy to the viceroy of Delhi to complain against the Sikhs and
            sought
            their help to assist the hill chiefs in destroying the Guru's power and expelling him from Anandpur.
            Accordingly the
            imperial forces were directed to assist the hill chiefs.</p>
        <p class="black">At the same time to save their faces, the hill chiefs pro posed to the Guru through Pamma Brahman, thatthey
            would be
            friends with him for ever only if he left Anandpur for a while and come back later. The Guru agreed to the
            proposal
            and left for Nirmoh, a village situated about a mile from Kiratpur. After he reached Nirmoh, Raja Ajmer
            Chand and
            Raja of Kangra both thought that since he was now in the open and he had no fort around him for protection,
            it would
            be better to launch an attack. They attacked the Guru's army without even waiting for the arrival of the
            imperial
            army. A fierce battle ensued in which the Sikhs were ultimately victorious. One afternoon as the Guru was
            sitting in
            his open court, the hill chiefs engaged a Mohammadan gunner to kill him for an adequate remuneration. The
            gunner
            fired a cannon ball which missed the Guru but took away the life of Sikh who was fanning im. The Guru picked
            up his
            bow and shot an arrow which killed the gunner and with another arrow killed his brother ho was assisting
            him. On
            seeing this the hill men quit fighting. The two Mohammadans were buried on the spot called Siyah Tibbi or
            the black
            hill and a Gurdwara was erected by the Sikhs to commemorate Guru's escape from the bullet.</p>
        <p class="black">The army of Wazir Khan, the viceroy of Sirhind, arrived in due time. The Guru found himself in a
            verydangerous
            position between the hill Rajas on one hand, and the imperial army on the other. But he resolved to defend
            himself
            in whatever way it was and his Sikhs stood faithfully and valiantly by him. Wazir Khan gave an order to his
            troops
            to make a sudden rush and seize the Guru. The Guru was successfully protected by his son Ajit Singh and his
            other
            brave warriors. They stopped the advance of the imperial forces and cut them down in rows. The carnage
            continued
            until night. Next day the imperial army and the hill chiefs made a furious assault when the Guru decided on
            retiring
            to Basoli whose Raja had frequently invited him to his capital. Until the Guru's army reached the river
            Satluj,
            fierce fighting continued in which brave Sahib Singh was slain. Bitting his thumb Wazir Khan admitted that
            he had
            never before witnessed such desperate fighting. The Guru with his troops crossed over the river and reached
            Basoli.
            The hill chiefs were overjoyed and presented elephants to Wazir Khan and departed to their homes. Wazir Khan
            returned to Sirhind. This battle was fought at the end of 1701.</p>
        <p class="black">Daya Singh and Ude Singh requested the Guru to return to Anandpur. After staying a few days at Basoli, he
            marched
            back to Anandpur and the inhabitants of the city were delighted to see him again among them.Finding the uru
            again
            firmly established at Anandpur, Raja Ajmer Chand thought it most wise to pursue for peace. The Guru told
            Ajmer Chand
            that he was willing to come to terms with him, but he would punish him if he were again found guilty of
            treachery.
            Ajmer Chand was glad to find peace with the Guru and he sent his family priest with presents to him. The
            other hill
            Rajas also followed Ajmer Chand's example and made good relations with the Guru.</p>
        <p>After this the Guru went to Malwa for the propagation of his mission. In January 1703 he went to a fair held
            at
            Kurukshetra on the occasion of a solar eclipse in order to purchase horses to replace those which were
            killed or
            stolen in previous warfare. The custom of sale and barter of horses and other animals at religious fairs was
            prevalent even during the time of the Guru.</p>
        <p class="black">Two Mohammadan generals, Saiyad Beg and Alif Khan, were on their way from Lahore to Delhi. Raja Ajmer Chand
            who also
            went to Kurukshetra along with other hill chiefs, thought to secure their assistance. He promised the
            generals large
            remuneration if they attacked the Guru. Instead on hearing favorable accounts of the Guru, Saiyad Beg
            withdrew his
            army, and when the battle ensued at Chamkaur between the Guru's and Alif Khan's troops, he joined the Guru's
            forces.
            Upon this Alif Khan retired from the contest thinking that he had no chance for victory. The Guru returned
            to
            Anandpur. Saiyad Beg threw his lot with him and accompanied him to Anandpur, and remained with him as a
            trustworthy
            and powerful ally.</p>
        <p>After two years of peace, the old hostilities reappeared. The reasons being, the increasing prestige of the
            Guru and
            the clashes as a result between the hill Rajas and the Sikhs.</p>
