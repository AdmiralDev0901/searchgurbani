                    <td><p>Chautal, variously referred to as Chartal, Chowtal, and even occasionally as Dhrupad tal, was
                            a very
                            common tal in the past. The names Chautal, Chowtal, and Chartal all mean &quot;four claps&quot;;
                            this is a reference to the four claps of its vibhag structure. A few musicians refer to this
                            tal as
                            Dhrupad tal. Although this is a considerably less common name, it clearly refers to its
                            strong usage
                            in the dhrupad tradition.</p>
                        <p>Chautal has 12 matras. But this is the only thing that we can say with absolute certainty
                            about its
                            structure.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be some disagreement as to the vibhag arrangement. One school of thought
                            contends that
                            it consists of four vibhags of 4, 4, 2, and 2 matras respectively. According to this school,
                            Chautal
                            has only claps and no waves of the hand. Therefore, each of the four claps corresponds to a
                            vibhag.
                            This is the version that is shown below. There is another school which suggests that the
                            structure
                            of Chautal is the same as Ektal. Therefore, it would be viewed as six vibhags of two matras
                            each.
                            According to this school, the vibhags are clap, wave, clap, wave, clap, clap.</p>
                        <p>Chautal is strongly linked to the pakhawaj tradition; this has profound practical and
                            theoretical
                            implications. It is performed in a very heavy, powerful manner which is in sharp contrast to
                            the
                            more delicate style of the tabla. Furthermore, there are difficulties when we speak of the
                            theka.
                            Where modern tabla players use the theka as the defining characteristic of the tal, pakhawaj
                            players
                            of old used the clapping / waving arrangement. Many suggest that the term &quot;thapi&quot;
                            should
                            be used instead of &quot;theka&quot; as an indication of this fundamental conceptual
                            difference.</p>
                        <p>The fact that there is not really a &quot;theka&quot;, but instead a &quot;thapi&quot; has
                            tremendous
                            practical importance. It is very normal for pakhawaj players to freely improvise in the
                            middle of
                            accompaniment. There is not the pressure to constantly play a simple &quot;theka&quot;. This
                            constant free improvisation may be at times disorienting to the modern concert goer who is
                            used to
                            the theka for the accompaniment of kheyal, dadra, thumri and other contemporary classical
                            forms.</p>
                        <p>Chautal tends to be played in the medium tempos only. One almost never hears extremely fast
                            (ati-drut) or extremely slow (vilambit) perfomances.</p>
                        <p>Below are the characteristics of Chautal:<br/>
                            CLAPPING/ WAVING ARRANGEMENT:clap 2, 3, 4, clap, 2, 3, 4, clap, 2, clap (disputed) <br/>
                            NUMBER OF BEATS :12<br/>
                            THEKA : Dhaa Dhaa Din Taa KiTa Dhaa Din Ta TiTa KaTa Ga Dee GeNa </p>
