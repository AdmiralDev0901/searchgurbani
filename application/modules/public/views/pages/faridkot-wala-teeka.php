        <h5>Faridkot Wala Teeka </h5>
        <p class="blue"> Faridkot Wala Teeka is classical exegesis of Sri Guru Granth Sahib in &lsquo;Braj Bhasha&rsquo; by a
            team of scholars of Nirmala Sect. It was the first attempt in this field prompted by Rulers of Faridkot State in 19
            th century. For all future attempts in this field, it became an ideal prototype. As it was patronized by the Rulers
            of Faridkot State, it came to be known as &lsquo;Faridkot Wala Teeka&rsquo;. </p>
        <p class="blue"> Teekas (commentaries) on Guru Granth Sahib have been written in one form or other ever since the
            compilation of Guru Granth Sahib. However, the first formal Teeka in line with the traditional interpretation of
            Sikh scriptures was written by Sant Giani Badan Singh Ji of Dera Sekhwan at the request and encouragement of
            Maharaja Bikram Singh of Faridkot. It took him six and a half years to complete it. It was completed in 1883. This
            Teeka was reviewed by a committee appointed by Mahant Shamer Singh of Patna. After incorporating the comments of
            this committee, the first edition of this Teeka was published [funded] by the Maharaja Balvir Singh of Faridkot in
            1906 which was printed by the Wazir Hind Press (started by Bhai Vir Singh) at Amritsar. The second edition of this
            Teeka was published by Maharaja Harinder Singh of Faridkot in 1928. This Teeka is known as the &quot;Faridkoti
            Teeka.&quot; </p>
        <p class="blue"> Pandit Tara Singh Narotam, the contemporary of the author of Faridkoti Teeka, also started the Teeka,
            but he died when he finished it up to Basant Rag. Then some people borrowed it from his heir just to review the
            draft, but never returned it. Only the Teeka of Sri Rag is available from his draft which is in the possesion of
            very few researchers and scholars at this time. It is not generally available.</p>
