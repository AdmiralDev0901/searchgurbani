                <p class="black"><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">There
                    are three Swaiyas authored by Bhatt Salh, entered in Adi Granth. Of these,
                    one Swaiya is in praise of the 3id Guru and two Swaiyas are in praise
                    of the 4th Guru. According to Bhatt Salh, the Gurus had attained the spiritual
                    height through meditation, dedication and devotion. They had captured
                    a victory over the worldly desires by controlling their mind. They had
                    subjugated the evils like passion, anger, greed, ego and lust and were
                    perfect examples of contentment, after acquiring the boon of Nam. <br/>
