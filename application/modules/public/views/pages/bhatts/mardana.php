                <p class="black"><img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>static/images/content/Mardana.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="233" align="left"/>Mardana
                    was the first disciple and lifelong companion of Guru Nanak and his
                    rebeck
                    player. With all the wit and humor of a Punjabi minstrel, Mardana became
                    a poet and philosopher in the Guru's company. He was a Muslim by birth
                    and a Mirasi or minstrel by caste and reÂ­beck player by profession.
                    Mardana was born at Talwandi Rae Bhoe Ki, the home-town. of Guru Nanak,
                    in 1459,
                    ten years before the birth of the Guru. Mardana's parents had lost all
                    their children. When Mardana was born, his mother out of sheer despair
                    and desperation called him Marjana, one who was about to die. But he
                    survived
                    and lived a fairly long life of sixty-one. Guru Nanak changed his name
                    to Mardana meaning brave or manly.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    His father was Badra and mother Lakho. Badra was the family bard of Mehta
                    Kalu. Badra and Mardana called every morning at the houses of local residents
                    and obtained alms generally in kind in the form of flour or some eatables.
                    Both would sing to the accompaniment of music on rebeck and on receiving
                    charity would move next door. Nanak as a child listened to their sweet
                    music and felt fascinated. He had a natural attraction for boy Mardana.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    In course of time, Nanak left Talwandi and went to Sultanpur Lodi where
                    he was employed in the service of Daulat Khan Lodi, the Governor of the
                    Jalandhar Doab. Mehta Kalu, Nanak's father, was not getting good reports
                    about Nanak's work. It struck him that Mardana's company might do him
                    good. Mardana was thirty years old when he was sent to Sultanpur. Nanak
                    was highly pleased at his arrival. It became usual with both of them to
                    sing songs together in praise of God in the morning and evening before
                    and after office hours, in a public place. Their melodious voice and soft
                    strains on rebeck touched the hearts of listeners and transported them
                    into a state of bliss. Both lived together and became inseparable. This
                    drama was daily enacted in the streets of Sultanpur for seven long years.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Then Nanak became a missionary, and he decided to move from place to place.
                    Mardana stuck fast to the Guru. Both left for Talwandi. While passing
                    through Muslim villages they stayed in a faqir's takia generally situated
                    near a graveyard. There they recited verses in praise of Allah. As Mardana
                    attended prayers in a mosque, Nanak also accompanied him, and some times
                    joined in prayers. The fanaticism of the Mulla or Maulvi was often softened
                    by the presence of Mardana. The Mulla thought that under Mardana's influence
                    Nanak might embrace Islam.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Visiting Sayyidpur and Sialkot on the way, they reached Talwandi. Nanak
                    stayed outside the town, while Mardana called upon his family folk. He
                    had a wife and two sons named Shahzada and Raezada and a daughter. Nanak's
                    parents called on him and tried to persuade him in vain to lead the settled
                    life of a householder. Mardana's wife and children also failed to detain
                    him. In a couple of days both left together for Multan. In due course
                    they returned to Sultanpur Lodi. This took place in 1496.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    In 1497 Nanak and Mardana started on a journey to the east. They went
                    as far as Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh and returned through Central India
                    to Panjab in 1509 after twelve years. At Delhi Nanak and Mardana were
                    both imprisoned by Sikandar Lodi for preaching in public in violation
                    of his orders. In jail both sang songs while Mardana played upon rebeck
                    also. This was a fascinating performance, and the prisoners thronged to
                    listen to them. Such a scene was rare in gaol. As this disturbed the normal
                    routine of the place, the Guru and his disciple were set free.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Guru Nanak undertook several journeys. His last journey was made to West
                    Asia from 1517 to 1521. Mardana was with him. From Sultanpur Lodi they
                    went in a boat down the river Beas and Satluj to Panjnad. From there they
                    passed through the country of Sind. In this tedious journey Nanak once
                    rode on horseback. They were halting in a jungle. The horse was let loose
                    to graze and Mardana was looking after it. Nanak suddenly called Mardana
                    to play a particular tune on. his rebeck. Mardana would not leave the
                    horse as it was trying to run. away. Nanak shouted:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    &quot;Let go the horse and come back at once. The word is coming.&quot; Mardana
                    quietly obeyed.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    At the old harbor of Kot Lakhpat they sailed for Arabia. Having visited
                    Mecca and Medina they went to Baghdad in Iraq, the capital of the Caliphs
                    of Islam. As usual they stayed outside the town near a graveyard. Nanak's
                    visit to Baghdad is recorded in the Vars of Bhai Gurdas who wrote:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Baba gaya Baghdad nun bahar jai kiya asthana,<br/>
                    1k Baba akal rup duja rabab Mardana.1<br/>
                    <br/>
                    [Baba went to Baghdad, and put up outside. The immortal Baba was accompanied
                    by the rebeck-player Mardana.]<br/>
                    <br/>
                    On the roadside Nanak began to sing hymns in praise of God, and Mardana
                    played a symphonic strain on his musical instrument. The language of the
                    people being Arabic listeners could only catch the names of Allah and
                    Khuda, but the combination of a melodious voice, sweet tune, and saintly
                    appearances produced a soothing effect on their minds. But as music was
                    a taboo in Islam, somebody objected to their performance remarking that
                    music turned mind from God towards sensuality. Nanak could understand
                    and speak some broken Arabic. He replied that God created music, and that
                    He was more easily accessible through pleasing poetry than pale prose.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The pilgrims stayed there for some time. Mardana's health and spirit had
                    been failing, and he felt tired of travelling. To reach home they had
                    to cover a distance of about 5,000 kilometres. If they could walk at the
                    rate of 20 kilometres a day it would take them 9 or 10 months. At this
                    prospect Mardana's heart began to sink. He had realised his life's ambition
                    of making a pilgrimage to the greatest holy places and sacred shrines
                    of Islam at Mecca, Medina and Baghdad. He had won the title of Haji. He
                    did not want to go farther. He felt that he would die at this holy place.
                    As luck would have it, he soon afterwards gave up the ghost in peace and
                    tranquility.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Nanak grew sad. The separation was unbearable. But the Guru had a stout
                    heart and an indomitable will. Besides he had a certain mission in life.
                    With a heavy heart he performed the obsequies of Mardana with his own
                    hands. A humble monument was erected in memory of Mardana. Within an enclosure
                    on a wall an inscription in mixed Turkish and Arabic marks the site. Mardana
                    was called Murad by the residents of Baghdad and being older than Nanak
                    by ten years was considered Guru. Consequently the inscription which was
                    put up after Guru Nanak's departure said:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    &quot;Guru Murad died. Baba Nanak faqir helped in constructing this building,
                    which is an act of grace from a virtuous follower, 927 A.H.&quot;&nbsp;
                    <br/>
                    Mardana seems to have died in December, 1520 A.D. at the age of 61. The
                    monument lies near a graveyard, 2.5 kilometres away from the railway station.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Mardana was a master-rebeck-player. He improved the old form of instrument
                    by fixing 4 to 6 strings to a hollow gourd so as to produce deep and mellow
                    resonance. He sang devotional songs of Kabir, Ravidas, Trilochan, Beni,
                    Dhanna and Nanak. He composed verses also, three of which are included
                    in the Adi Granth in Bihagre ki Var. They are against the use of wine
                    which brings about misery, lust, pride, self-conceit, falsehood, ill health
                    and disease. He says:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The barmaid is misery, wine is lust; man is the drinker.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The cup filled with worldly love is wrath, and it is served by pride.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The company is false and covetous, and is ruined by excess of drink.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Instead of such wine make good conduct thy clarified butter, and modesty
                    thy meat to eat.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Such things, O Nanak, are obtained by the Guru's favour; by par-taking
                    of them sins depart.'<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Mardana's last wish to Guru Nanak a little before his death was:<br/>
                    <br/>
                    &quot;Only ferry me across this ocean of the world for the sake of the
                    Word of God, which I have been singing to thee and thy people.&quot;<br/>
                    <br/>
                    On his return to Panjab Guru Nanak called at Talwandi. His parents had
                    died. Mardana's parents also were no more. He condoled with his wife and
                    sons. He persuaded Mardana's eldest son, Shahzada, to accept his father's
                    post, and assured him of equal honour, care and consideration. Shahzada
                    accompanied the Guru to Kartarpur, and served as the chief minstrel to
                    the Guru as well as to the Sikh sangats. </p>
                <hr/>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana was Guru Nanak's long-time Muslim companion throughout his
                    extensive journeys across the country and abroad, he was born the son
                    of a mirasi (a caste of hereditary minstrels and genealogists) couple,
                    Badra and Lakkho, of Talvandi Rai Bhoe, now Nankana Sahib, in Sheikhupura
                    district of Pakistan. Guru Nanak and Mardana grew up in the same village.
                    The Meharban Janam Sakhi describes the latter, who was ten years senior
                    in age, as the Guru's companion since his childllood days and as one who
                    sang to him songs from Kabir, Trilochan, Ravidas, Dhanna and Beni. According
                    to Ratan Singh Bhangu, Prachin Panth Prakash, Guru Nanak as a small boy
                    gave Mardana a String instrument improvised from reeds to play on while
                    he sang the hymns . </p>
                <p class="black">As Guru Nanak was employed to take charge of the granaries and stores
                    of the Nawab of Sultanpur lodhi, the stories of his generosity and hospitality
                    spread far and wide. Mardana, already a married man and father of two
                    sons and a daughter, wanted to visit Sultanpur and seek his bounty. Meanwhile,
                    he was charged by Guru Nanak's father Mahita Kalu, to go to Sultanpur
                    and bring news of the welfare of his son. Mardana went to Sultanpnr, never
                    to part company with Guru Nanak again. His occupation was playing the
                    Ribab rebeck as Guru Nanak recited God's glory. </p>
                <p class="black">When Guru Nanak Prepared to go forth into the world to preach his message,
                    he invited Mardana to accompany him. Mardana hesitated, for he did not
                    wish to leave his family until his daughter had heen married off and for
                    this he did not have sufficient means. One of Guru Nanak's disciples,
                    Bhai Bhagnath, bought the needed provisions and Mardana was able to give
                    away his daughter in marriage. He was then ready to accompany Guru Nanak
                    on his travels. </p>
                <p class="black">To relieve the rigour of the journeys, the biographies describe several
                    humorous situations in which Mardana involved himself by his panicky behaviour
                    when prospects of getting the next meal seemed less than certain. He was
                    not easily convinced when Guru Nanak told him to be patient and have trust
                    in something turning up, but Mardana wished always to be prepared before
                    travelling with the rations. As the Puratan Janam Sakhi narrates, Guru
                    Nanak and Mardana had not come out very far from Sultanpur when the latter
                    complained that he felt hungry and needed something to eat immediately.
                    The Guru pointed to the village they had passed and said that, if he went
                    , he would he well entertained by Khattris of the Uppal caste who lived
                    in that village Mardana turned his footsteps in that direction and, arriving
                    in the village, he found ever more than hospitable. he was fed sumptuously
                    and given ample alms. As he saw him loaded With a bundle Guru Nanak, says
                    the Janam Sakhi, rolled on the ground laughing, since the bundle was very
                    heavy. Mardana realized the oddity of what he had done and did not know
                    how to get rid of what he had collected. He threw the bundle when Guru
                    pointed out to him that those articles would be more of a burden to him. </p>
                <p class="black">The janam sakhis also contain many anecdotes
                    picturing Mardana in despair out of agonizing hunger or petrifying
                    fear and Guru Nanak or Nature coming
                    to succour him some what miraculously. Once the two were passing through
                    a remote wilderness when suddenly a violent storm overtook them. So
                    severe
                    was the tempest that the trees of the jungle began to fly about. Mardana,
                    trembling With fear, thus spoke to the Guru, &quot;True sovereign, thou
                    hast brought me to my death in this forest. I shall not here get a shroud
                    nor a grave.&quot; The Guru asked him to remain calm, but Mardana moaned,
                    &quot;I have not faced a calamity like this in my life. What is going
                    to befall my poor soul today?&quot; Then fire broke out. Smoke was all
                    over and the blaze on all four sides. Mardana covered up his face and
                    laid himself down on the ground saying, &quot;Farewell, life&quot; Then
                    came water. Thick clouds gathered and poured water in torrents &quot;Raise
                    thy head, Mardana,&quot; spoke the Guru, &quot;and take thy rebeck &quot;
                    Mardana pulled the strings and Guru Nanak sang: &quot;If the fear of
                    God is in the heart, all other fear is dispelled...&quot; </p>
                <p class="black">According to Puratan Janam Sakhi, Mardana and
                    his Master were taken prisoner by the Mughals at Saidpur. The Guru
                    was given a load to carry on his head
                    and Mardana to lead a horse holding its rein. Mir Khan, the Mughal commander,
                    saw that the Guru's bundle was floating above his head and Mardana's
                    horse
                    was following him without the reins. He reported the miracle to Sultan
                    Babar, who remarked, &quot;Had there been such faqirs here, the town should
                    not have been struck&quot; . Mir Khan asked him to see for himself. </p>
                <p class="black">In 1524, at Kartarpur, Mardana, fell ill. He
                    grew weak and hope of recovery was lost. Born of a Muslim family, he
                    had attached himself to Guru Nanak.
                    The Guru asked him how he wished his body to be disposed of Mardana replied
                    that by the Guru's instruction he had overcome his pride of the body.
                    What remained of him after death, he said, be disposed of as the Guru
                    wished. Then the Guru said. &quot;Shall I make thee a tomb to render thee
                    famous in the world?&quot; &quot;when the Guru is releasing my soul from
                    the body, why should he entomb me in stone?&quot; answered Mardana The
                    Guru asked him to fix his mind on the Creator The following morning,
                    at
                    a watch before day, Mardana passed away. The Guru consigned his hody
                    to the River Ravi, hymns sung and karahprasad, the sacrament, distributed
                    among the Sikhs. He consoled Mardana's son Shahzada, and other members
                    of his family and asked them not to weep for him who had returned to
                    his
                    heavenly home. </p>
                <p class="black">Mardana was a poet of some merit. One of his slokas appears in Guru Granth
                    Sahib in Bihagare ki Var along with two others of Guru Nanak's addressed
                    to Mardana. He is convinced that an evil body may be cleansed of sin in
                    sangat (GC, 553). </p>
                <hr/>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana is the most significant character identified in Janam Sakhis
                    after Guru Nanak. Naturally, such honor leaves a deep impression in the
                    readers mind. Bhai Mardana enjoyed the unique honor of being a helper
                    as well as a close confidant of Guru Nanak Dev. Bhai Gurdas places Guru
                    Nanak on the prime pedestal while placing Bhai Mardana on second pedestal.</p>
                <p class="black">&quot;Ek Baba Akal Rup Duja Rababi Mardana&quot;<br/>
                    Meaning, one Baba (referring to Guru Nanak in Almighty's forms accompanied
                    by the second Rababi (musician, player of Rabab) Mardana.<br/>
                    This great soul was immensely blessed with the closeness of Guru Nanak
                    Dev Ji. Undoubtedly, Bhai Mardana always accompanied Guru Nanak. Yet historians
                    have hesitated to discuss Bhai Mardana. Whatever sketchy details available
                    on his life are incomplete at best and misrepresentative. They are insufficient
                    for a thorough and true assessment of his role, contributions, and stature.</p>
                <p class="black">Due to the lack of historical material, it is difficult to write much
                    about Bhai Mardana. Nevertheless, we attempt this presentation with the
                    following thoughts.</p>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana Ji is the very first entry in Sikh
                    chronology. He was born approximately 10 years prior to Guru Nanaks
                    birth, in 1459, at Rai-Bhoay-Di-Talwandi
                    (district Shekhupura). His mother's name was Bibi Lakho and father's
                    name was Bader of Marasi caste. He was the seventh child of his parents.
                    The
                    earlier six offsprings had died immediately upon birth. Accordingly,
                    some think that he was named &quot;Mur Jana&quot; -- one to die and Guru Nanak
                    Dev Ji changed his name to &quot;Marda Na&quot; -- meaning not to die.
                    However, this isn't believable, since Guru Nanak Sahib was born 10 years
                    after Bhai Mardana. According to Principal Satbir Singh, Bhai Mardana's
                    childhood name was &quot;Dana&quot; and Guru Sah renamed him &quot;Mardana&quot; (emphasizing,
                    in man ways) to influence him towards high moralistic life. This seems
                    a more plausible and believable viewpoint.</p>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana Ji and Guru Nanak Dev Ji were childhood friends since they
                    lived in the same village.</p>
                <p class="black">Being member of the Marasis Rababi fraternity, Bhai Mardana was an accomplished
                    musician. He inherited this art from his family ancestors. Guru Nanak
                    was deeply impressed by his art and that was probably an underlying reason
                    for their strong bond.</p>
                <p class="black">While it is well established that Bhai Mardana
                    was married, no information is available on when he get married and
                    to whom. He had at least one child
                    who wasn't lost by history. His was known as Bhai &quot;Sagged,&quot; who
                    performed kirtan in Guru Angad Dev's Darbar.</p>
                <p class="black">Guru Nanak Dev resigned from his job as storekeeper of a provision store
                    at Sultanpur Lodhi (Kapurthala), and decided to answer his call to rescue
                    this world and establish peace. Mehta Kalu sent Bhai Mardana to Sultanpur
                    to ascertain Guru Nanak's well being. However, Bhai Mardana got entangled
                    in the bonds of Guru's affection and did not return. Guru Nanak successfully
                    sought Bhai Mardana's commitment (sewa) for his cause. It seemed Guru
                    Nanak was waiting for this moment and did not want to make any moves without
                    ascertaining Bhai Mardanascommitment.</p>
                <p class="black">Whenever Bani ascended, the strings of Bhai Mardana's Rabab initiated
                    tantalizing vibrations. The holy shabad, right from its origins in Suchkhand,
                    would ride the inaccessible and unapproachable musical tunes and descend
                    into Guru Nanak's soul. Subsequently, Guru Nanak would expose it to the
                    world. During this process, Bhai Mardana's Rabab served to transform the
                    sacred inaccessible and unapproachable music into expressive tunes for
                    this world.</p>
                <p class="black">Once Bhai Mardana inquired the reasons behind
                    Guru's recluse. Guru responded, &quot;Listen Mardania, I had blessed you with the string art and longed
                    for this day. It is good that you asked this question.&quot; Guru Ji clarified;
                    &quot;Mardania all I have is hunger and poverty with me. If you desire
                    comforts then return to Talwandi.&quot;</p>
                <p class="black ">Guru Sahib had decided to settle at Kartarpur.
                    So without reneging Talwandi, how could Mardana proceed to Kartarpur?
                    Talwandi was representative of
                    all worldly attachments, family worries, and material accomplishment
                    while Kartarpur was Creator's place, representative of good deeds,
                    sewa, simran
                    and true happiness. Mardana reneged all his attachments to Talwandi,
                    saying, &quot;Returning has become difficult for me now. Where could
                    I go? I dont see anyone else like you in this world.&quot;</p>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana Ji dedicated himself for the heavenly and sacred mission
                    of Guru Nanak Dev. Undoubtedly he was the very first to sacrifice himself
                    for the Sikh faith. Bhai Mardana's far sightedness and auspicious vision
                    adopted the hunger and poverty filled, most difficult, path.</p>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana was extremely simple, pure, honest and friendly. He was
                    a person of very high moral principles and qualities. Persistent like
                    a child he couldn't hide his inner thoughts and feelings. However, his
                    behavior never irritated Guru Sahib who always treated with him with love,
                    affection, and softness.</p>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana had all the worldly qualities and characteristics. For this
                    reason he could always seek answers to his doubts and questions from Guru
                    Sahib.</p>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana was simple natured while Guru Nanak Dev Ji was a master
                    of unique strengths who possessed knowledgeable of both worlds - this
                    as well as the next. Despite his humbleness, Bhai Mardana was successful
                    in exposing Guru's divine knowledge and insights to the world. Yet he
                    never exhibited any signs of ego.</p>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana Ji was well aware that the person
                    he accompanied wasn't any ordinary human being. He always lived in
                    submission to Guru Baba's
                    orders. He had a deep faith in Guru Baba. For such devotion and qualities,
                    Guru Baba always kept him close by and never parted his company. Guru
                    Nanak Dev Ji blessed Bhai Mardana, saying; &quot;Mardania if you are
                    exalted and delighted, so too is this world.&quot;</p>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana, as a result of Guru Nanak Dev Ji's blessing, had acquired
                    the ultimate understanding. He understood the mysterious and incomprehensible
                    secrets of the universe from Guru Baba.</p>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana received yet another unique honor that no subsequent Sikh
                    could acquire. The middle saloks of Bihagada's vaar are dedicated to Bhai
                    Mardana. This is evident of Guru Nanak Dev's deep love and affection for
                    Bhai Mardana.</p>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana's role in Janam Sakhis is one of helper. As a helper, Bhai
                    Mardana developed the plots to seek answers from Guru Nanak Sahib. His
                    difficulties with resisting hunger, repeatedly wanting to return home,
                    expressing greediness, being fearful, pretending to be devoid of understanding
                    and knowledge, etc. are merely symbolic roles. All such characteristics
                    can only belong to someone who doesnt shed such evils yet owns the ultimate
                    truth. Evidently, the Mardana of Janam Sakhi is very different from true
                    Mardana and the Sakhi's authors have used him symbolically. Dr. Gurcharan
                    Singh clarifies by suggesting that:</p>
                <p class="black"><br/>
                    &quot;Such roles are written in contradiction with Guru Nanak Sahib's
                    divine knowledg and insights. However, Mardana's involvemen in such small
                    worldly worries not only sharpens Guru Sahib's divine insights but enlighten
                    them like the sun.&quot;</p>
                <p class="black">According to Bhai Khan Singh, Bhai Mardana died on 13th Mugar Sanmat
                    1591 in Afghanistan on the banks of Kuram. Guru Nanak himself cremated
                    his body. This is implausible because Guru Nanak Dev Ji was in Kartarpur
                    in Sanmat 1591. Further his return trip, if any, to Afghanistan for Bhai
                    Mardana's cremation is not mentioned anywhere. On the other hand, some
                    historians have stated that Bhai Mardana died in Kartarpur, 8 days after
                    Guru Nanak Dev Ji's death. Yet Hari Ram examined the engraved writings
                    of Baghdad and declared that Bhai Mardana died there during the Baghdad
                    trip. As such it is difficult to determine when Bhai Mardana die and where?</p>
                <p class="black">In conclusion, all we can say that Bhai Mardana was a person of utmost
                    religious character. However, his roles mentioned in Janam Sakhis are
                    difficult to reconcile. Yet they do not diminish any of his qualities.</p>
                <p class="black">Bhai Mardana was the very first kirtania of Sikh history. His Rabab,
                    even to this day, serves as the source of motivation for our kirtanias.
                    Every Sikh, as well as kirtania, can learn a lot from his selfless dedication,
                    sacrifice and humility filled life.</p>
