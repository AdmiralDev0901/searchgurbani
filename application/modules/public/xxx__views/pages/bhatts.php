    <p> Bhatt Bani (the hymns by the bards) comprising twenty pages is incorporated
        in the concluding part of Adi Granth. The Bhatts are supposed to be the
        descendants of Koshish Rishi and are linked with the Sarshat Brahmins.
        It is a fact that almost all the eleven Bhatts belonged to Punjab and
        were residents of Sultanpur Lodhi (district Kapurthala) where Guru Nanak
        had served in the Modikhana for 13 years. According to Bhatt chronicles
        they were sons or nephews of Bhikha and Toda Bhatts. </p>
    <p> During the medieval times Bhatts were more popularly known as the
        baliad singers whose profession was to compose and sing martial songs.
        With their narrative and descriptive poetry of war, they led the warriors
        to the battlefield. When the warriors marched to the battlefield in order
        to wage a war against the enemy invaders they would narrate to them the
        heroic deeds of their forefathers, who had laid their lives for the honour
        of the motherland. They recited the martial poems and aroused passion
        of the heroes for war and love for the motherland. The compositions of
        these Bhatts as included in Adi Granth are in the form of eulogies to
        the first five Gurus. They used the popular form of poetry called Swaiya
        Chhand. They wrote their Swaiyas in a very distinctive style. Their language,
        very rich and full of poetic imagery, is packed with elegant and decorative
        vocabulary. The eleven Bhatts whose Bani is included in Adi Granth are
        : Kalshar, Jalap, Kirat, Bhika, Salh, Bhalh, Nal, Gyand, Mathura, Bal
        and Harbans. It is said that they had come to the fifth Guru in a group
        led by Bhatt Kalshar. It appears some of them had also attended earlier
        the congregations of Guru Amardas and Guru Ramdas. </p>
    <p> According to the chronicler Sant Singh Bhatt
        as written in Bhatt Bahi, &quot;It was the ninth generation of Bhatt
        Bhagirath that was blessed with an eminent poet and scholar known as
        Raiya, who had six sons named
        Bhika, Sokha, Tokha, Gokha, Chokha and Toda. The Swaiyas entered in Adi
        Granth mostly are authored by sons and grandsons of Raiya, with the
        exception
        of Bhatt Nal. The compositions of these Bhatts popularly known as Bhatt
        Bani comprise of 123 Swaiyas, written in praise of the first five Gurus.&quot; </p>
    <p> A significant point to be noted in this respect is that these Bhatts
        were not mercenaries who wrote for money, on the other hand their compositions
        were the genuine expression of their love and regards for the Gurus. They
        were dedicated followers of Gurus and their poetry was the spontaneous
        articulation of their deeprooted respects for the house of Nanak. According
        to them right from Guru Nanak onwards, all the Gurus were the carriers
        of the same light, they were all the incarnations of Guru Nanak, who on
        his part was the Avtar (embodiment) of Lord 'Vishnu. Oneness of the spirit
        of the Gurus was the main theme of their Swaiyas. </p>
    <p> Bhai Kahan Singh Nabha, author of Mahan Kosh has referred to an en
        the `Sooraj Prakash' by Gyani Santokh Singh which accepts the Bhatts incarnations
        of Vedas. In other words he has accepted their scholarship, acknowledging
        them as the store-house of Vedas. Dr. Mohan Singh Diwan . The History
        of Punjabi Literature has accepted them as the court poets of the G who
        endeavoured to establish the social, religious and the spiritual state
        of Gurus in beautiful language. </p>
    <p> According to records it is stated that Bhatt Bani was incorporated Adi
        Granth in AD 1604 by Guru Arjun Dev, the fifth Guru, the compiler of the
        Ha Granth. During the life time of the fifth great spiritual leader of
        the Sikhs thei compositions were sung by balladeers, Satta and Balwand
        in the congregations melodious tunes to enthrall the audience with their
        devotional overtone. </p>
    <p>BANI, recorded under the title Savaiyye, is the
        name popularly given to the compositions of the Bhatts as included
        in
        the Guru Granth Sahib (pp. 1389-1409). Bhatts were bards or panegyrists
        who recited poetry lauding the grandeur of a ruler or the gallantry of
        a warrior. Bhatt was also used as an epithet for a learned Brãhman. In
        the Sikh tradition, Bhatts are poets with the personal experience and
        vision of the spirituality of the Gurus whom they celebrate in their verse.
        According to Bhãi Santokh Singh, Sri Gur Pratãp Süraj Granth, &quot;They were
        the Vedas incarnate&quot; (p. 2121). The Bhatts are-said to have originally
        lived on the bank of the River Sarasvati which is also the name of the
        Indian mythological goddess of knowledge. They were thus called Sãrasvat,
        i.e. the learned Brãhmans. Those living on the other side of the Sarasvat
        were called Gaur. They showed little interest in learning and contended
        themselves with alms given them by their patrons whose bansãvalinãmãs
        or genealogies they recorded in their scrolls called vahis. They are still
        found on the bank of the Sarasvati in the Talaudã (Jind), Bhãdsoñ (Lãdva)
        and Karsindhu (Safidoñ) villages in Haryãnã. Some of these families shifted
        over to Sultanpur Lodhi, now in Kapurthalã district of the Punjab, and
        settled there. Bhikhã and Todã of these families embraced the Sikh faith
        during the time of Guru Amar Dãs.</p>
    <p
    >&nbsp;Bhãi Gurdãs also gives in his Vãrãñ, XI. 21, a brief account
        of these Bhatts. What was the number of Bhatts whose compositions are
        included is a question not yet firmly answered. According to a tradition,
        Kalh, a leading Bhatt poet, took it upon himself to note down some of
        the verse of the Bhatts from the vahis and passed it on to Guru Arjan
        at the time of the compilation of the Holy Book. As for the number of
        Bhatt contributors to the Guru Granth Sahib, Sahib Siñgh, Tejã Singh,
        Tãran Siñgh and other modern scholars count 11 of them, whereas Santokh
        Siñgh (Sri GurPratãp Suraj Granth), Bhai Vir Singh (Guru Granth Kosh)and
        some others among the traditional scholars count 17, and Panclit Kartãr
        Singh Dãkha puts the figure at 19. This variation in owed to the fact
        that the Bhatts used to sing in&nbsp; chorus and sometimes the chorus
        sung in&nbsp; a group went in the name of the leader at other times &nbsp;individually
        in the members of the group.</p>
    <p>From among the
        17 Bhatts positions figure in the Guru Granth Sahib, Bhikhã, son
        of Rayyã,
        was a resident of &nbsp;Sultãnpur Lodhi and had been a follower
        of Guru Amar Dãs. Of the total 123 savaiye in the Guru&nbsp; Granth Sahib
        two are of his composition, both in praise of Guru Amar Das Of the remaining
        sixteen Bhatt contributors four are his sons; Kalh, also called or Kal
        Thãkur, who is reckoned to be the most learned of all the Bhatts, has
        10 in praise of Guru Nãnak, 9 each&nbsp; of Guru Añgad and Guru Amar Das,
        13 in&nbsp; praise of Guru Ram Das and 12 in praise of Guru Arjan; Jalap
        who had migrated to Goindvãl with his father has four his name all of
        which are in praise of Guru Amar Das; Kirat (d. 1634) has eight savaiye,
        four each in praise of Guru Amar Das and&nbsp; Guru Ram Dãs; and Mathurã
        12, all in praise of&nbsp; Guru Ram Dãs. Salh who has three savaiye extolling
        the pre-eminence of Guru Amar Dãs (1) and Guru Ram Dãs (2), Bhalh who
        has one savaiyya in praise of Guru Amar Dãs were the sons of Sekhã, a
        brother of Rayya. Balh who has five savaiye stressing the spiritual oneness
        of the Gurus was son of Tokhã, another brother of Rayya. Haribañs, the
        eldest son of Gokha, a brother of Rayya, has two savaiyyes , both in praise
        of Guru Arjan. Nalh has five savaiyyes all in praise of Guru Ram Das.
        Das also spelt dasu or dasi, has composed ten savaiyyes including one
        conjointly written with Sevak, who in addition to this has four savaiyye
        of his own. Parmanand has five savaiyyes are in praise of Guru Ram das,
        Tal's single one in praise of Guru Añgad .Jalan has two savaiye in praise
        of Guru Ram Das, Jalh one in praise of Guru Amar Dãs and Gayand five which
        glorify Guru Ram Dãs. Of the total 123 , ten each pay homage to Guru Nãnak
        and Guru Angad, 22 to Guru Amar Dãs, Ram Dãs and 21 to Guru Arjan.</p>
    <p>The main purpose of these savaiye is to &nbsp;acclaim the Gurus, not as
        individuals but as the revelation they embodied.The Bhatts see the Gurus
        as one light, as one spirit passing from one body to the other. Bhatt Kirat
        for instance: &quot;Just as (Guru) Angad was ever the part of Guru Nãnak's being
        so is Guru Ram Dãs of (Guru) Amar Dãs's&quot; Again, Bhatt Kalh: &quot;From Guru Nanak
        was Angad: from Angad, Amar Dãs received sublime rank. From Guru Ram Das
        descended Guru Arjan, the great devotee of God&quot; (GG, 1407). This concept
        of all the Gurus being one light, one voice has informed all along the Sikh
        belief and development and constitutes today a fundamental&nbsp; principle
        of the faith.</p>
