    The Guru travelled many miles in the wilderness of Assam. His minstrel Mardana was very hungry and tired, so they
    sat under a tree. After sometimes Mardana went to get something to eat. On his way he met Kauda, the cannibal. Kauda
    took Mardana by surprise and bound him hand and foot by a rope and then carried him to the spot where he had kept a
    big pan full of oil for frying the flesh of his victims. Kauda started to lighten fire under the pan. When Mardana
    saw that, he was very frightened and prayed to the Guru to come to his rescue. The Guru already knew and was on his
    way to get him released.<br/>
    <br/>
    Kauda was trying to light the fire when the Guru appeared. This bewildered Kauda completely. The Guru looked at him
    compassionately and graciously and said,&quot;Kauda! See-est thou not what thou dost, wilt thou cast thyself in the
    burning fire of hell?&quot; The very gracious and holy sight of the Divine Master made such people realize their
    guilt and they fell on his feet and begged for mercy. Kauda whose conscience was dead with heinous crimes, suddenly
    came to realization and was overwhelmed with repentance. He fell on the feet of the Master and prayed for mercy. The
    gracious Master blessed him with the Name. Kauda was completely a changed man and thereafter lived as a devout
    disciple of the Guru.</p>

    After Golaghat Nagar and Dhanasri valley where cannibals inhabited in large numbers, the Guru went back to Gauhati.
    From there he proceeded to Shillong</p>
<p>and to Silhet where an old Gurdwara stands in his memory. He then went to Dacca and on the way he passed through
    Calcutta and Cuttack and finally reached Puri.</p>
<p>The temple of Jagan Nath, the Lord of the East, was one of the four most revered temples of the Hindus- the other
    three being Som Nath, Badri Nath and Vishwa Nath. It is said that Jagan Nath's idol was sculptured by the architect
    of the gods and it was installed at the temple by Lord Brahma himself. It was the anniversary of installation of the
    idol when Guru Nanak reached the temple. The Guru visited the temple not to adore their Lord but to teach the people
    that the worship of God was superior to the worship of the deity. It was the evening time and the priests brought a
    salver full of many lighted lamps, flowers, incense and pearls and then all stood to offer the salver to their
    enshrined idol-god. The ceremony was called 'Arti', a song of dedication. The high-priest invited the Guru to join
    in the god's worship. The Guru did not join their service which enraged the priests. On being asked the reason the
    Guru explained that a wonderful serenade was being sung by nature before the invisible altar of God. The sun and the
    moon were the lamps, placed in the salver of the firmament and the fragrance wafted from the Malayan mountains was
    serving as incense. The Guru, therefore, instead of accepting the invitation of the high-priest to adore the idol,
    raised his eyes to the heaven and uttered the following Sabad of Arti: </p>
<p>&quot;The sun and moon, O Lord, are thy lamps; the firmament<br/>
    Thy salver; the orbs of the stars, the pearls enchased in it.<br/>
    The perfume of thesandal is Thine incense; the wind is<br/>
    Thy fan; all the forests are Thy flowers, O Lord of light.<br/>
    What worship is this, O Thou Destroyer of birth?<br/>
    Unbeaten strains of ecstasy are the trumpets of Thy worship.<br/>
    Thou hast a thousand eyes and yet not one eye;<br/>
    Thou hast a thousand forms and yet not one ;<br/>
    Thou hast a thousand pure feet and yet not one foot;<br/>
    Thou hast a thousand organs of smell and yet not one organ-<br/>
    I am fascinated by this play of Thine.<br/>
    The Light which is in everything is Thine, O Lord of Light.<br/>
    From its brilliancy everything is brilliant;<br/>
    By the Guru's teaching the light becometh manifest.<br/>
    What pleaseth Thee is the real Arti.<br/>
    O God, my mind is fascinated with Thy lotus feet as the<br/>
    bumble-bee with the flower: night and day I thirst for them.<br/>
    Give the water of Thy grace to thesarang Nanak, so that he<br/>
    may dwell in Thy name.&quot; (Dhanasri Mohalla 1, Arti, p-663) </p>

<p>According to the Puratan Janamsakhi, the Guru ended his first Udasi with the visit to Puri and returned to Punjab.
    After some time he took his second Udasi to cover the south. If the Guru had returned from Puri, he must have
    visited some important places on his way back, but there is no mention of it in the Janamsakhi. However, the
    Meharban version of the Janamsakhi treats the eastern and the southern journeys as a single Udasi. Others argue that
    the geographical location of Puri is as such that a visitor planning to visit south India, would not return to
    Punjab and then start for the southern journey. Many writers therefore, believe that the Guru continued his
    southward journey from Puri.<br/>
</p>
<p><a name="3" id="3"></a>GURU TO SANGLADEEP (CEYLON):</p>
<p>From Puri the Guru went to Gantur of present Andhra Pradesh district, Kanchipuram, Tiruvannamalai and
    Tiruchchirupalli. All these places have Gurdwaras to mark the visit of the Guru. From Tiruchchirupalli he sailed
    down to Kaveri river and reached Nagapatnam, a very old port of south India. From there he proceeded to Sangladeep
    (Ceylon) and Betticola was the first place of his stay in the island. He went to Matiakalam (now known as Matalai)
    which was the capital of Sangladeep under Raja Shiv Nabh.</p>
<p>Bhai Mansukh, a trader from Punjab and a disciple of the Guru, had been to Sangladeep in connection with his business
    long before the Guru's visit to the island. By reason of his trade, Bhai Mansukh had access to Raja Shiv Nabh and
    thus he had told the Raja all about Guru Nanak. The Raja inquired how he could meet the Guru. Mansukh told him,&quot;Rise
    early in the morning and recite Moolmantar. If you earnestly pray, the Guru will respond to your prayers.&quot;</p>
<p>Every morning Raja Shiv Nabh meditated and prayed for the holy sight (darshan) of the Guru. Time passed on but the
    Guru did not appear. Many persons came and claimed to be the Guru but all were found to be the fake claimants. One
    day news was brought to the Raja that a holy man, with a rare glory beaming on his face (spiritual aura), had
    arrived in the old neglected garden, and as soon as he set his foot in the garden, the withered trees sprouted into
    green foliage.</p>
<p>Due to the previous fake claimants, the Raja devised a plan to test the visitors before he could bow his head to any
    one of them. The Raja, therefore, sent beautiful girls to seduce the new- comer with their beauty and charm. The
    report was sent to the Raja that the girls not only failed to seduce the visitor, but they themselves had been
    transformed under his spell. Hearing this, the Raja hurriedly came to see the holy Master. Spontaneously he fell at
    the feet of the Guru. The Guru placed his hand on his head and blessed him. Who could describe the ecstatic joy that
    had dawned upon Raja.</p>
<p>The whole city rushed to the garden to have holy sight of the Master. A dharamsala, a religious common place, was
    built where the Guru held daily religious congregations and preached his divine doctrine. People were enlightened
    with God's Name and they became Guru's followers.</p>
<p>After staying there for some time the Guru started in the southerly direction and reached Katargama. Then he reached
    Sita Eliya, a place where Sita spent her period of captivity. At the time of Guru Nanak's visit, this place was in
    the Kotte kingdom of Raja Dharma Prakarma. The inscription discovered by Dr. Karuna Ratna and Parana Vitana in the
    famous museum of Anurodh Pura, furnishes a brief account of the encounter of Jnanakacharya (Nanak) with the Buddhist
    Bhikshu, Dharma Kirt-sthavira. This inscription also informs that the Raja Dharma Prkramabahu had promised to
    embrace Guru Nanak's creed if he won in the debate. Guru Nanak won. But before he could embrace the Guru's creed,
    the Brahmans very cleverly arranged another public debate, this time between the Guru and Dharma Dvajapandita and
    maneuvered the result in favor of the latter. In this way they did not let the ruler fall under the influence of the
    Guru.</p>
