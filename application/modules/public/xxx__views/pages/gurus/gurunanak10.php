<h2>Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji</h2>
<p><strong>COMPOSITION AND COLLECTION OF BANI:</strong></p>
<p>These were the years when most of the Guru's disciples received religious instructions from him and who recorded what
    they received. Many devotees, it is said, copied the daily prayers and hymns. These collections were called 'Bani
    Pothis' (books of hymns). The Bani Pothi compiled during his life time was passed on to the second Guru, Guru Angad
    Dev.<br/>
</p>

<p>Although the Guru had settled down at Kartarpur, but he still took small tours within the radius of 100 to 200 miles
    around Kartarpur. He went to many places and preached his gospel of Nam. At many of these places, the people became
    Guru's followers and they set up Gurdwaras in his honor.</p>
<p><strong>GURU AT ACHAL BATALA:</strong></p>
<p>About 25 miles from Kartarpur, there was a place called Achal Batala where on the occasion of Shivratri festival,
    hundreds of Jogis used to come to take part in the festival. The Guru also went to Achal <a
        onmouseover="drs('The Yogi.'); return true;" onmouseout="nd(); return true;"
        href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>gurus/page4_1.htm">Batala </a>to preach his doctrine. Thousands of people came
    from far and near to see and hear him. There were three camps- one of the Jogis, another of the Guru and the third
    one of a party of musicians. More and more people gathered around the Guru's camp than that of the Jogis. This made
    the Jogis very angry and jealous and they were determined to humble the Guru.</p>
<p>Whatever the money the musicians were getting from the audience, they put it in a bowl. Somehow the Jogis stole their
    bowl full of money and hid it someplace thinking that the musicians would go to the Guru for help and if the Guru
    was unable to locate the bowl, he would be humbled.</p>
<p>Knowing about the greatness of the Guru, the musicians went to the Guru for help to find their bowl of money. The
    wonderful Guru told them about the mischief of the Jogis and recovered their bowl from the hiding place. Thus the
    Jogis suffered a tremendous defeat.</p>
<p>Next attack from the Jogis came through a discussion. As mentioned before the Guru after his travels, laid aside the
    pilgrim's apparel and had put up ordinary dress of a family man. The Jogis said,&quot;O Guru, you are a holy man but
    you are wearing the garb of a family person. Why does a holy man lead a family life?&quot; Jogi <a
        onmouseover="drs('Bhangarnath was a head Jogi.'); return true;" onmouseout="nd(); return true;"
        href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>gurus/page4_1.htm">Bhagarnath</a> further asked the Guru,&quot;When the milk
    becomes sour, no butter is produced by churning it, why have you cast away your hermit's dress and donned ordinary
    clothes?&quot;</p>
<p>The Guru replied,&quot;O Bhangarnath, your mother was an unskilled woman. She knew not how to wash the churn, and so
    spoilt the butter in producing thee. Thou hast become an anchoret after abandoning thy family life, and yet thou
    goest to beg to the houses of family men.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon this reply the Jogis were enraged and through their miraculous powers, they started to harass the Guru. One Jogi
    became a cobra to frighten the Guru, the other became wolf and other started rain of fire. The powerful Guru sat
    calmly unperturbed and unharmed. When the Jogis were beaten badly, Bhangarnath asked the Guru that he exhibited
    miracles to the world, why he was slow to exhibit the same to them?</p>
<p>The Guru replied that he had no miracles except the True Name, and he uttered the following Sabad: </p>
<p>&quot;Were I to put on a dress of fire, construct a house of snow and eat iron;<br/>
    Were I to turn all my troubles into water, drink it, and drive the earth as a steed;<br/>
    Were I able to put the firmament into one scale and weigh it with a <a
        onmouseover="drs('Tank is one weight measure in India. One tank is equal to the weight of 256 grains of Rice. It means that if he is able to perform such a miracle.'); return true;"
        onmouseout="nd(); return true;" href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>gurus/page4_1.htm">tank</a>;<br/>
    Were I to become so large that I could be nowhere contained;<br/>
    and were I to lead every one by the nose;<br/>
    Had I such power in myself that I could perform such things or cause others to perform them, it would be all in
    vain.<br/>
    As great as the Lord is, so great are His gifts; He bestoweth according to His pleasure.<br/>
    Nanak, he on whom God looketh with favor obtaineth the glory of the True Name.&quot;<br/>
    (Majh di Var, Slok Mohalla 1, p-147) </p>

<p>The Jogis then finally complimented the Guru on his success and said,&quot;Hail, O Nanak, great are thy deeds! Thou
    hast arisen a great being, and lit a light in this age of falsehood (kalyug) in the world.&quot;<br/>

<p><a name="25" id="25"></a><strong>ASCENSION OF GURU NANAK:</strong></p>
<p>The Guru, knowing that his time to depart was approaching, had to appoint his successor. His sons had not obeyed him
    and so they did not prove themselves to be worthy of Guruship.</p>
<p>On September 2, 1539 (2 Asu, 1596 Asu vadi 5) Guru Nanak placed five Paise (Indian currency) before Bhai Lehna and
    bowed to him in token of his succession to the Guruship. He placed the umbrella of Spiritual Sovereignty over Bhai
    Lehna's head. <strong>Thus, he created another Nanak and called him GURU ANGAD DEV.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Jot uha jugat sai seih kaya feir paltiai.&quot; (Ramkali ki Var- Rai Balwand, p-966) </p>
<p>'Divine Light is the same<br/>
    The Way and Mode are the same<br/>
    The Master has merely changed the body.' (Translation of the above)</p>

<p>When Guruship was passed on to Guru Angad, people realized that Guru Nanak was soon to depart bodily from the world
    (As a Divine Light and Spirit, the Guru is always present). The Sikhs, the Hindus and the Muslims came from all over
    to have holy glimpse of Guru Nanak.</p>
<p>After the proclamation of Guru Angad, the sons asked their father, what provision he had made for them. Guru Nanak
    replied,&quot;O my sons, God is the Cherisher of His creatures; you shall obtain food and clothing in abundance, and
    if you repeat God's name you shall be saved at last.&quot;</p>
<p>Guru's Muslim devotees wanted to bury him after his death. His Hindu followers desired to cremate his body. When the
    Guru was asked for his decision, he replied,&quot;Let the Hindus place flowers on my right and the Muslims on my
    left. Those whose flowers are found fresh in the morning, may have the disposal rights of my body.&quot;</p>
<p>The Guru drew a sheet over him. When the sheet was removed next morning, body was not found underneath, but the
    flowers on both sides were afresh. The light blended with Light and the spirit went back and merged with the Master
    Spirit. It confirms that the Guru was not a body but it was the Divine Light.</p>
<p>The Hindus and the Muslims removed their respective flowers and cut the sheet into two. The former cremated the sheet
    and the latter buried it. It happened at Kartarpur on September 22, 1539 (23rd day of Asu, Vadi 10, Sambat 1596). He
    was about seventy and a half years of age.</p>
<p>The Sikhs built a Gurdwara and the Muslims a tomb in his honor on the bank of river Ravi. Both had since been washed
    away by the river, perhaps by a superact, so as to avoid idolatrous worship of the Guru's last resting place.</p>
<p>Rituals and superstitions earned the sanctions of old times. Religion had degenerated into ceremonial acts only. The
    life and teachings of Guru Nanak offer consistent evidence of fruitlessness of rituals. He exposed their hollowness
    and exhorted human beings to rise above such customs. Guru Nanak's religion excluded all senseless dogmas and
    meaningless rituals. With no sword or stick armed with Divine Word, he preached that only Impersonal Absolute is to
    be worshiped. Any religion which does not guard its values indicates a lower level of development and is deemed to
    disappear in the long run.</p>
