<h2>Sri Guru HarGobind Sahib Ji</h2>
<p><strong><a name="1" id="1">KAULAN:</a></strong></p>
<p>The Qazi had a beautiful daughter, Kaulan who was a disciple of Mian Mir. From her childhood she had occupied her
    mind praising God's Name and remembering Him in the company of the saints. Through the holy company of Mian Mir, she
    had heard praises of Guru Har Gobind and she praised him in the midst of her own family. This incensed her father
    very much who addressed her,&quot;O Infidel, you praise an infidel (Guru) and obey not the law of Mohammad,
    according to which it is forbidden, under penalty of death, to praise an infidel.&quot; Kaulan replied,&quot;Father
    dear, the law of Mohammad does not apply to holy men. Saints are God's servants.&quot; On hearing this from her
    daughter, the Qazi burnt with bigotry and indignation. After consulting his brother Qazis, he issued an order for
    the execution of his daughter, Kaulan for her sin of transgressing the Mohammad law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kaulan's mother informed her daughter and Mian Mir about the order of the Qazi. Mian Mir recommended to aulan,&quot;There
    appears no means of saving you here. It is better if you go to Amritsar and seek protection of Guru Har Gobind. None
    else but he can save your life.&quot; Kaulan heeded Mian Mir's advice and went to Amritsar.</p>
<p>Kaulan began her life at Amritsar under the protection of the Guru. She was given a separate building to reside.
    Kaulan found consolation in repeating following Sabad:</p>
<p>&quot;O mother, I awake by association with the saints;</p>
<p>On seeing the love of the Beloved, I repeat His Name which is a treasure.</p>
<p>Thirsting for a sight of Him, I long and look for Him;</p>
<p>I have forgotten my desire for other things.</p>
<p>I have found Guru, the giver of composure and peace;</p>
<p>On beholding him, my mind is wrapped up in God.</p>
<p>On seeing God pleasure hath arisen in my heart; Nanak dear to me is His ambrosial Word.&quot;</p>
<p>(Kedara Mohalla 5, p-1119)</p>
<p>Quite a bit of time passed in this manner until one day she took all her jewels and placed them before the Guru and
    said,&quot;O friend of the poor, please apply the price of these jewels to some religious object by which my name
    may be remembered in the world for sometime.&quot; The Guru got a tank excavated in her name with that money in
    1621. The tank is still famous as Kaulsar in the city of Amritsar. Guru Har Gobind also constructed another tank
    called Babeksar commemorating the deliverance of his spiritual address on that spot to his followers. There are now
    five sacred tanks in Amritsar in the vicinity of Golden Temple:</p>
<p>Santokhsar, Amritsar, Ramsar, Kaulsar, and Babeksar.</p>

<p><strong><a name="2" id="2">MUGHAL FORCES AND THE GURU:</a></strong></p>
<p>Emperor Jahangir had died in Kashmir and his son Shah Jahan became the Emperor of India. When Prithia's son, Meharban
    heard Chandu's death, he was greatly distressed. Meharban said to himself,&quot;Sulhi Khan died when he set himself
    against the Guru. My father died as he was against the Guru. Now Chandu has died. What magic the Guru possesseth
    that no one may withstand him.&quot; Meharban exchanged turban with Karam Chand, Chandu's son, in token of life-long
    friendship, and then discussed ways with him how to bring about the Guru's ruin. They started poisoning Shah Jahan's
    mind against him. Guru Har Gobind sent his revered Sikhs to Meharban to dissuade him from his hostile and evil
    designs. He also went himself to Meharban to strike a conciliatory note but in vain. Shah Jahan pursued a different
    religious policy. He served to orthodoxy, and religious fanaticism was at a considerable height during his reign. He
    took keen interest in the welfare of new converts to Islam. If any Muslim gave up his religion, he was severely
    dealt with. Some temples under construction in Punjab were demolished and mosques were raised in their places. His
    mind was poisoned against the Guru by his enemies and soon the ties of cordial relations as they had been since
    1611, were snapped and a period of open hostility started towards the Sikhs. On his way to Pilibhit, the Guru
    visited Kartarpur where he met some Pathans of village, Wadamir, equipped with swords and shields who offered their
    services to him. With them was a tall and powerful youth, Painde Khan. His parents were dead and he was living with
    his uncle. The Guru enlisted Painde Khan on his personal staff and continually pampered him to increase his
    strength. He could, without the aid of a rope or bridle, arrest a horse running at full speed. No wrestler would
    engage with him. The Guru practised all martial exercises and collected arms of every description. He hunted and
    witnessed exhibitions of strength by Painde Khan and others. He presented to Painde Khan the offering made by the
    Sikhs. This caused great heart-burning and worry to others. A deputation of Sikhs went to Bhai Gurdas who in turn
    sent them to Bhai Buddha. Bhai Buddha represented to the Guru,&quot;Thou art like the Ganges, like the sun and like
    the fire. The river Ganges swallows corpses and bones of the countless dead, and yet remains pure; the sun draws
    noxious vapors towards it, and yet remains pure; fire burns the dead, yet remains pure. Thou art like all three. The
    Sikhs seeing your love and enthusiasm for sport and military exercises, fear for you. Therefore, please abandon
    them.&quot; The Guru laughed and replied,&quot;I have done nothing improper. I am only fulfilling your prophecy and
    elevating the conditions of my Sikhs.&quot;</p>

        <td> A n orphan Pathan lad Paindey Khan (d.1634 AD) was brought up and trained in the art of warfare by Guru
            Hargobind Sahib. Paindey Khan led Mughal forces against Guru Ji and died at the hands of the Guru at the
            battle of Kartarpur. Before the Pathan breathed his last, Guru Ji asked him his last wish. He begged to be
            pardoned. Guru Ji forgave him and covered his face from the burning sun with his shield.

<p>Preparations were made for the marriage of the Guru's daughter, Bibi Viro, and sweets were prepared and stored in a
    room. A company of Sikhs came from the west to behold the Guru and present their offerings. They were weary and
    hungry and reached late at night when kitchen was closed. The Guru desired that the sweets stored for the marriage
    should be served to his visitors. The key of the room was with Guru's wife, Mata Damodri who refused to give the
    sweets to any one till the bridegroom's party had partaken of them. The Guru again asked but his wife adhered to her
    determination. Upon this the Guru predicted,&quot;My Sikhs are dearer to me than life. Were they the first to taste
    the sweets, all obstacles to the marriage would be removed, but now the Mohammadans shall come and possess
    themselves of the sweets and marriage be interrupted.&quot; This prophecy became true. In the meantime a Sikh
    brought sweets which were served to the Guru's visitors.</p>
<p>Emperor Shah Jahan went hunting from Lahore towards Amritsar. The Guru also went in the same direction. A clash took
    place between the Sikhs and the royal soldiers over the issue of a royal hawk. One of the royal hawks who was flying
    after a victim, strayed away and fell in the hands of the Sikhs. The royal soldiers came to recover the hawk but
    because of their arrogance and abusive language, the Sikhs refused to hand over the hawk and this started the
    trouble. The royal soldiers were driven away with a slaughter. They hastened back and reported to the Emperor about
    the seizer of the hawk and the violence of the Sikhs. The enemies of the Guru found a good opportunity to revive the
    charges against him and to remind the Emperor of Guru's alleged misdeeds.</p>
<p>The Emperor sent Mukhlis Khan, one of his trusted generals with seven thousand soldiers to punish the Sikhs. The
    Sikhs of Lahore hearing of the military expedition against the Guru, sent immediately a messenger to Amritsar o
    apprise the Guru of the attack. There were great rejoicing going on at the palace of the Guru on account of his
    daughter's marriage. The Guru's family was immediately removed to a house near Ramsar. Early next day it was decided
    to send the family to Goindwal. It so happened that the coming day was fixed for Viro's marriage. Thus the Guru
    ordered that his family and all the non-combatants of the city should halt at Jhabal, a town about seven miles
    south-west of Amritsar and the marriage should be celebrated there before going to Goindwal. Two Sikhs were sent to
    stop the bridegroom's procession, lest it should fall in the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>There was a small fortress, Lohgarh, outside the city. It was a kind of raised platform (serving as a tower) where
    the Guru used to hold his court in the afternoon and it was surrounded by high walls. Twenty-five Sikhs were osted
    there in an anticipation of the attack. The Guru went to the temple and prayed for the victory. He repeated the
    following verse on the occasion:</p>
<p>&quot;Wicked men and enemies are all destroyed by Thee, O Lord, and Thy glory is manifested.</p>
<p>Thou didst immediately destroy those who annoyed Thy saints.</p>
<p>&quot;(Dhanasri Mohalla 5, p-681)</p>
<p>The Sikh detachment at Lohgarh though courageous were too few to stop the Mughal army. After estroying hundreds of
    the enemy soldiers, they fell martyrs to the Guru's cause. The enemy soldiers proceeded to the Guru's palace in
    search of him but became furious finding the palace empty. They searched the house and took care of the sweets. With
    the day break, began the conflict, the clashing of swords and the hissing of the bullets. Brave men fell and died,
    blood flowed in profusion, corpses were piled over one another, heads, bodies, arms, and legs were separated and
    horses without riders careered around the city.</p>
<p>Bhai Bhanu was the commander-in-chief of the Guru's army and Shams Khan was one of the chiefs of the mperial army.
    Shams Khan's horse was killed. Bhai Bhanu then dismounted, and he and Shams Khan engaged in a single combat. Bhai
    Bhanu told Shams Khan,&quot;I will not allow you to escape now.&quot; Shams Khan replied,&quot;Defend yourself, I am
    going to strike.&quot; Bhai Bhanu received the sword on his shield, and putting forward all his force, beheaded
    Shams Khan with one blow. The Mohammadans seeing their commander slain, rushed to Bhai Bhanu and surrounded him from
    all sides. He cut down the enemy as if they were radishes. At last he was struck by two bullets which passed through
    his body and the brave commander of the Guru's army left for his heavenly abode.</p>
<p>Bhai Bidhi Chand, Painde Khan and Bhai Jati Mal had been committing great havoc among the Mohammadan army. They,
    lifting their lances, made their enemies' horses riderless. The Guru himself fought so bravely that no one when
    struck by him, asked for water again. Painde Khan was equally successful in the combat. He made Didar Ali, the last
    survivor of Mukhlis Khan's personal staff, bite the earth.</p>
<p>Mukhlis Khan, now left alone, thought nothing remained for him but to engage the Guru himself. He said,&quot;Let you
    and me now decide the fight by single combat, and none else approach.&quot; In order to please him, the Guru warned
    his own men to stand aside. He then discharged an arrow which killed Mukhlis Khan's horse. The Guru dismounted and
    said,&quot;Show thy skill and strike the first blow.&quot; Mukhlis Khan aimed a blow which the Guru avoided by a
    swift movement. The next blow fell on the Guru's shield. The Guru then warned,&quot;You have made two strokes which
    I have parried. Now it is my turn.&quot; The Guru then lifting his powerful arm dealt Mukhlis Khan such a blow that
    his head was cut off in two.</p>
<p>Painde Khan, Bhai Bidhi Chand and Bhai Jati Mal killed the enemy soldiers who held the ground but the majority of
    them fled without looking behind. After that the Guru's victory was complete and the drums of victory were joyously
    sounded. This battle was fought in 1628 (some date it as 1634). The battle was extended to a distance of about four
    miles to the south of Amritsar and a dharmsal called the Sangrana was erected to commemorate the Guru's victory. A
    fair is held every year on this spot.</p>
<p>After completing the last rites of his brave soldiers, the Guru went to Jhabal and performed the marriage ceremony of
    his daughter. </p>

<p>On hearing the death of Mukhlis Khan and the defeat of his army, Shah Jahan called a council of his chiefs at which
    it was decided that the Guru should be captured or killed lest he should seize the reins of the empire. Wazir Khan,
    a follower of the Guru, defended him and said,&quot;Sir, the Guru is not a rebel and has no designs on thine empire.
    Had he ever got such a design, he would have followed his victory, seized some fortress, taken some territory or
    plundered some of thy treasuries. Is it not a miracle that with only seven hundred men he destroyed the army of
    seven thousand?&quot; These and many such arguments of Wazir Khan were supported by the friends of the Guru at the
    court. The Emperor was convinced and agreed to forget the past. After the conflict the Guru went to Kartarpur.
    Painde Khan soon became a concern to the Guru as he began to boast,&quot;It is I who conquered the countless hosts
    opposed to the Guru at Amritsar. With my arrow I skewered them like trussed fowl. Had I not been there, no one would
    have had the courage to oppose them. The Sikhs would have all fled.&quot; The Guru heard this. Painde Khan who used
    to wait on him whole day and go to his quarters just to sleep, was ordered by the Guru to remain at his home and
    visit him only occasionally. This was his reprimand for Painde Khan's boasting. It was a rainy season and the Guru
    after crossing the river Beas, went to the right side of the bank which was lofty. He observed that the land
    dwellings were only in one direction and the rest of the land was unoccupied. He considered it a good site to Found
    a city. The people received him with open arms but the landlord and Chaudhry, Bhagwan Das Gherarwere not in favor of
    him. Gherar started hostilities against him and used abusive language. Upon this a clash broke out in which Gherar
    was killed.</p>
<p>Having secured the goodwill of the people, the Guru made preparations for the city. He cut the first sod himself and
    summoned masons and laborers from the neighboring villages. The city subsequently was called Sri Har Gobindpur in
    his honor.</p>
<p>Rattan Chand, son of the Gherar, vowed to avenge the death of his father. He went to Karam Chand, Chandu's son, and
    urged him to join him against the common oppressor (Guru). They both then went to Abdulla Khan, the Subedar of
    Jullundhur. Rattan Chand poured his grievances and represented how pleased the Emperor would be if the Guru were put
    into his hands and what high promotion the Subedar would receive.</p>
<p>The Subedar and his advisors were convinced by Rattan Chand's arguments and an immediate expedition was planned and
    organized against the Guru. When the Guru heard about the expedition, he simply said,&quot; What pleaseth God is
    best.&quot; The Subedar had an army of ten thousand men. He disposed his forces into eight divisions, five for his
    generals, two for his sons and one for himself. The Guru gave his command to Bhai Jattu, Bhai Bidhi Chand, Bhai Jati
    Mal, Bhai Mathura, Bhai Jaganath, Bhai Nano and others.</p>

            forgets death and always remembers God. Guru Ji counselled her not to engage herself in the persuit of
            wordly things but instead she should try to comprehend truth and discharge the duties of a true wife .

<p>Under the favoring glance of the Guru, the Sikhs who had formerly been weak as hares now became strong as lions. No
    matter what their birth or previous calling, they all proved themselves as gallant heroes in the field. After all
    the generals of Abdulla fell in the battle field, he resolved to conquer or die. Karam Chand, Rattan Chand and
    Abdulla Khan all three came on the Guru, who then asked Karam Chand and Rattan Chand,&quot; What think you on? Now
    avenge your fathers. Retreat not like cowards. Be brave and stand before me; otherwise go where your fathers have
    gone.&quot; The Guru struck Karam Chand with his shield and made him stagger and fall. Rattan Chand ran to his aid
    but was shot. Abdulla struck few blows which the Guru received on his shield. Then gathering his strength he drew
    his falchion on the Subedar, and severed his head from his body. By this time Karam Chand recovered his
    consciousness and rushed towards the Guru. There ensued a sword- play between the two until the sword of the latter
    was broken. The Guru as a holy man desiring to take no mean advantage of his adversary, put his own sword into his
    scabbard, and engaged with him in a wrestling combat. At last the Guru, seizing Karam Chand by both arms, swung him
    around and dashed his head to the ground. The Subedar and all his generals were slain and his army had fled, the
    battle was ended and victory kissed the feet of the Guru.</p>
