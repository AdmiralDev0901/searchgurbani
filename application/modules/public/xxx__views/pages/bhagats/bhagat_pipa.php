<p><strong>BHAGAT PIPA</strong>,
    one of whose hymns is incorporated in the Guru Granth S&atilde;hib, was
    a prince who renounced his throne in search of spiritual solace. He was
    born at Gagaraun, in present-day Jhalawar district of Rajasth&atilde;n,
    about AD 1425. He was a devotee of the goddess Bhav&atilde;ni whose idol
    was enshrined in a temple within the premises of his palace. The goddess,
    it is said, once told him in a dream to visit K&atilde;shi (V&atilde;r&atilde;nasi)
    and receive initia&shy;tion from R&atilde;m&atilde;nand. Pip&atilde; went
    to K&atilde;shi, but Ram&atilde;nand refused to see him in his gaudy robes.
    Pip&atilde; cast off his royal apparel and put on a mendicant&#8217;s
    garment. He returned home after initiation and began to live like an ascetic.
    At his invitation Ram&atilde;nand visited Gagaraun, and the raja lent
    his shoulder to the palanquin carrying him in a procession. Pipa now finally
    decided to give up his throne and retire to a life of seclusion and meditation.
    He wept to Dwark&atilde; (Gujar&atilde;t) where Lord Krishna, after the
    Mah&atilde;bh&atilde;rata war, had spent the last years of his life. All
    the twelve wives of.Pipa insisted on accompanying him, but he took along
    only one, named Sit&atilde;, who was of a pious temperament. He selected
    a cave for his residence from where he daily walked through a tunnel to
    the temple of Krsna on the sea coast. The temple is still a popular place
    of pilgrimage. and a fair is held there annually in Pipa&#8217;s memory.
    After what he thought was a personal encounter with the Lord, he gave
    up idol-worship. He and his companion-wife started living in a jungle.
    After a period of penance, he set out roam&shy;ing about the country to
    serve the common people. He, along with his wife, sang hymns and prayers
    of his own composition and collected money to be distributed among the
    poor. He fed the mendicants and treated them as God&#8217;s chosen ones.
    From an idol-worshipper (saguna bhakta) Pip&atilde; became a worshipper
    of the Formless One (nirguna devotee). As he says in his hymn in the Guru
    Granth S&atilde;hib, the body itself is the Supreme Being&#8217;s temple
    (k&aacute;iau deval). One need not make stone images of Him and burn incense
    or light candles in front of them. <br/>
    Two collections of Pipa&#8217;s sayings are known to exist, namely Sh&ntilde;
    Pipa ji Bani and Sarab Gutaka, both in manuscript form. Pip&atilde; Math,
    a monastery in Dw&atilde;rk&atilde;, honours his memory. </p>
<p> Shabad by Bhagat Pipa</p>
<blockquote class="blue">
    <p><em>Within the body, the Divine Lord is embodied.<br/>
            The body is the temple, the place of pilgrimage, and the pilgrim.<br/>
            Within the body are incense, lamps and offerings.<br/>
            Within the body are the flower offerings. || 1 ||<br/>
            I searched throughout many realms,<br/>
            but I found the nine treasures within the body.<br/>
            Nothing comes, and nothing goes;<br/>
            I pray to the Lord for Mercy. || 1 || Pause ||<br/>
            The One who pervades the Universe also dwells in the body;<br/>
            whoever seeks Him, finds Him there.<br/>
            Pipa prays, the Lord is the supreme essence;<br/>
            He reveals Himself through the True Guru.</em></p>
