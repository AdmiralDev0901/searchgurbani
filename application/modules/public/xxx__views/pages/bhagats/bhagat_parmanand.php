    a Mah&atilde;rashtrian saint-poet, one of whose hymns is included in the
    Guru Granth S&atilde;hib. Born probably in 1483, he is believed to have
    resided at B&atilde;rsi, situated to the north of Pandharpur, in present-day
    Shol&atilde;pur district of Mah&atilde;r&atilde;shtra. Parm&atilde;nand
    was a devotee of Vishnu and used in his songs the nom de plume Sara&ntilde;g,
    the name of a bird ever thirsty for the rain&shy;drop. He always longed
    for God whom he worshipped in the Vaisnavite manifestation of Krsna. He
    used to make, it is said, seven hundred genuflexions daiy to God on his
    uncovered, often bleeding, knees. He believe for a long time that God
    could be worshipped as an Image only, but later he had the realization
    that the nirguna Supreme, God unmanifest, could also be loved and prayed
    to.Parminand&#8217;s one hymn incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib (p.
    1253) subscribes to this view. In this hymn, he disapproves of the ritualistic
    reading and hearing of the sacred books If that has not disposed to the
    service of fellow beings.He commends sincere devotion which could be imbibed
    from the company of holy saints. Lust,wrath, avarice, slander have to
    be expunged for they render all seva, ie. service, fruitless </p>

    <span>Shabad from Parmanand in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib</span></p>
<blockquote>
    <strong><p><br/>
            <em>So what have you accomplished by listening to the Puraanas?<br/>
                Faithful devotion has not welled up within you,<br/>
                and you have not been inspired to give to the hungry. || 1 || Pause
                ||<br/>
                You have not forgotten sexual desire,<br/>
                and you have not forgotten anger; greed has not left you either.<br/>
                Your mouth has not stopped slandering and gossiping about others.<br/>
                Your service is useless and fruitless. || 1 ||<br/>
                By breaking into the houses of others and robbing them,<br/>
                you fill your belly, you sinner.<br/>
                But when you go to the world beyond, your guilt will be well known,<br/>
                by the acts of ignorance which you committed. || 2 ||<br/>
                Cruelty has not left your mind;<br/>
                you have not cherished kindness for other living beings.<br/>
                Parmaanand has joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<br/>
                Why have you not followed the sacred teachings? || 3 || 1 || 6 ||<br/>
                O mind, do not even associate with those who have turned their backs
                on the Lord.</em></p></strong>
