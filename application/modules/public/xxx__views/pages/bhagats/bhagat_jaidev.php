        (JAYADEVA</strong>), saint and poet, two of whose hymns are incorporated
    in the Guru Granth S&atilde;hib, is chiefly known to the literary world
    as the author of the Gita Govinda, a lyrical poem in which the love of
    R&atilde;dh&atilde; (soul or devotee) for Govinda (the Supreme Being)
    is described symbolically and mystically. Jaidev was born at Kindu Bilv&atilde;
    which, according to some, is now Kenduli, in Birbh&uuml;m district of
    West Bengal, on the river Ajay and, according to others, Kend&uuml;li-Sasan,
    on Prachi river, near jagannath Puri in Oriss&atilde;. At the end of his
    poem, he has given his father&#8217;s name as Bhojadeva and mother&#8217;s
    as R&atilde;dh&atilde;devl, deciphered also as Ram&atilde;devi, or V&atilde;madcvi.
    He is said to have flourished in the reign of Raja Karnarnav (AD 1142-56)
    and R&atilde;j&atilde; Purushottam Dev (AD 1170-80), both of Oriss&atilde;.
    Several legends about him are recorded in the Bhaklamal of Chandradatta.
    In his youth, he led the life of an ascetic and a wandering preacher.
    The course changed for him as, while in Puri once, a Br&atilde;hmarm forced
    the hand of his daughter on him. It turned out to be a happy marriage.
    His wife sang with him the devotional songs which were of his own composition.
    He spent some years at Katham Kancli, now called Jaidevpur in his memory,
    where he composed his immortal lyric, the Gita Govinda. From devotee of
    Lord Krsna he became a devotee of the Supreme Lord. He roamed about the
    country preaching the gospel of love of God and of man. R&atilde;j&atilde;
    Lakshmian Sen (AD 1175-1200), of Bengal, became his disciple. Jaidev lived
    long and died in the village where he was born, in happy retirement. There
    is a samadhi of the saint in the village and an annual fair is belch on
    the first of Magh. </p>
<p>Besides the Gila Govinda, two other com&shy;positions, the Rasan&atilde;
    Raghava, a drama, and the Chanthalok, an essay on the grace of style,
    are also ascribed to him. <br/>
    Jaidev&#8217;s hymns in the Guru Granth S&atilde;hib, one in Raga Gujari
    and the other in R&atilde;ga M&auml;r&uuml;, are in adoration of Hari,
    the Supreme Being. &#8220;Duality,&#8221; he says, &#8220;ended for me
    as I remembered God who is the fountainhead of all virtue. Cherish the
    Divine Name in your heart. By repeating His praise you will break the
    circuit of birth and death, and you will dread death no more. Your heart
    and your word and deed should be imbued with the love of One Hari alone.&#8221;
    Bh&atilde;i Gurdas in his V&agrave;ra&ntilde;, X. 10, pays tribute to
    Jaidev&#8217;s loving devotion whereby he attained the state when no distinction
    remains between &#8220;the devotee and the infinite.&#8221;</p>
<p> Bhagat Jaidev was a Saint &amp; Poet, his childhood name was Pardharmrik,
    and was born in the southern part of Bengal. His mother's name was Rama
    Devi (also called Bani Devi by some) &amp; father's name was Bhojdev.
    The village of Jaidev's birth is situated in the district of Bir Bhumi
    on the River Ajay. Jaidev was orphaned early in childhood. He used to
    express grief at the loss of his parents by composing sad songs, and then
    by singing them. Narinjan, one of his father's friends, fraudulently usurped
    the entire family property, this helped trigger Jaidev's tendency toward
    renunciation &amp; detachment even further. It was in such a mood of detachment
    that Jaidev devoted himself to the worship of Lord Krishna. His austere
    nature became so strong and intense that he used to avoid sitting in the
    shade of a tree for long lest it should attach him to the comfort it provided
    and become an obstacle in the way of God-realisation. He had attachment
    only to God, and he used to sing His eulogies through His compositions.
    Thus, three volumes of his compositions came into being to be known as
    1. Darshan Raghav 2. Geet Govinde 3. Chandia-Lok. Of these, his Geet Govinde
    has been generally accepted as better in terms of Poetics, music and thought
    contents. It is accepted amongst his followers that the Lord Akalpurkh
    himself would take the bodily form of Jagan Nath, so as to listen to his
    book and hear His eulogies face to face. As a result of his intense devotion
    towards Krishna, he was able to compose beautiful, mystical poetry. He
    remained for some time, a court poet &amp; one of the five famous 'jewels'
    in the court of King Lachhman Sain of Bengal. Jaidev returned tohis native
    village towards his later years. He was too old &amp; weak to go to the
    River Ganga to bathe therein. However, floods caused a miracle, perhaps
    an outburst of a devotess's love for his deity. The Ganga river naturally
    shifted its course a little and started flowing just by Jaidev's residence.
    What wonderful example of Nature's love for its devotes!</p>
<p> Once it so happened that Jaidev stopped midway completing a verse, and
    God himself comleted it in his absence. Impressed further by this miracle,
    Jaidev dedicated himself more intensely to the worship of Lord Krishna.
    So he renounced his household and wide (Padmavati) and left for the forest
    to devote himself fully to the Master. In the forest, he found the word
    'Geet Govinde' written on each leaf. This is how the Divine Spirit revealed
    itself to Jaidev. &quot;Whichever direction I look to, I find only the
    Lord and nothing else&quot;, but his is only one side of the coin, the
    other is as follows:</p>
<p> According to the 10th stanza of Ver X of Bhai Gurdas, when God Himself
    completed the verse left incomplete by Jaidev, the latter felt proud that
    God liked his verse so much that He showed inclination to complete it.
    No sooner had this ego erupted in his mind, he was surprised to find that
    the contents of his book 'Geet Govinde' was written on each leaf of the
    tree. Thus this miracle put an end to his pride. He made a supplication
    to God Almighty with utter humility and prayed that this lapse on his
    part be ignored. He had then realised that God is Omniscient, and is capable
    of doing anything. Man, however great, powerful and famous he may be,
    is nothing against Him. In fact, whatever a human being is, he is due
    to God's grace. After this incident, Jaidev's love, reverence and devotion
    towards God became more intense and immense. Guru Arjan Dev Ji, in his
    hymn recorded on Aang 1192 of Siri Guru Granth Sahib, has made an allusion
    to this and to Jaidev discarding this egoist tendency: Guru ji has said: </p>
<p>jYdyv iqAwigE AhMmyv ] (1192-10, bsMqu,
    mhlw 5)<br/>
    Jai Dev gave up his egotism.</p>
<p> Guru ji has reffered to many saints &amp; holy-men in this hymn &amp;
    states that different saints achieved oneness with the Lord through different
    means. If Dhanna realised Him through his innocence, Jaidev achieved Him
    through eradicating ego from his mind. Kabir concentrated on the Divine
    for long and ultimately became one with Him. Ajarnal, Balmik &amp; prostitute
    Ganika realised God through constant remembrance of Him, by listening
    to the Divine Name from a parrot, respectfully. With the help of these
    instances, the Guru advises the seeker that he should make use of this
    human birth and remember the Lord. He cautions us against all those adverse
    effects of ego which Jaidev had fallen prey to. <br/>
    Bhagat Jaidev of Bengal was a contemporary of Sheikh Farid of Punjab.
    Two hymns of Jaidev are found recorded in the Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji
    under 'Gujri'measure (Aang 526) and Maru measure (Aang 1106). Both these
    hymns were collected by Guru Nanak when during one of his preaching odysseys
    (1508-1515), Guru ji visited his village. These hymns were later included
    in the Scripture by Guru Arjan Dev.<br/>
    Jaidev's hymns included in the Gujri measure can be summed up as follows:
    the true Lord is immanent in all places. He who ever remembers Him is
    freed from the fear of transmigration, old age, disease and suffering.
    His heart, his words, his deeds become pious. If a man has to win over
    the God of Death, it is necessary to seek the protection of the Timeless
    One. The grace of such a One is eternal &amp; pervasive and is constantly
    bestowed throughout the preceding 3 eras. The only need is to remove all
    feelings of discrimination and differentiation which become possible only
    by remembering Him and singing His praises. Therefore O man, you should
    give up greed, lust and anger and seek His shelter, only then can you
    realise Him. Guru Nanak has also reiterated similar views in one of his
    hymns appearing in Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, at Aang 505.<br/>
    In the other hymn included in the Maru measure, Jaidev expresses his deep
    devotion in the Real One. He states that he recites the Divine Name for
    16 times only with the passing of one breath. In other words, it implies
    that he does not waste any moment of his breathing &amp; remain engaged
    in the remembrance of God who is an epitoe of nobility. Thus, he has overcome
    all distinctions of mine and thine between God and himself. He feels,
    that he has merged with God, just as a droplet merges with water. The
    love of the Divine has satiated all his desires. As such, he realised
    the Lord and thus broke the circuit of life and death.<br/>
    Jaidev shares with us a very important event and experience on the way
    to God-realisation. Through this, he advises and inspires us to make Divine
    remembrance an integral part of our life so that we are able to achieve
    the ultimate aim of life.<br/>
    Although only two of Jaidev's hymns are included in the Siri Guru Granth
    Sahib Ji, many more of his verses are extant I his Geet Govinde, Darsan
    Raghav &amp; Chandra-Lok. People of Bengal, Orissa and Andhra recite these
    hymns with due devotion &amp; reverence.<br/>
    Simply two hymns of Jaidev have merged him with the Shabad-Guru and thereby
    immortalised him. Jaidev died in 1273AD. </p>
