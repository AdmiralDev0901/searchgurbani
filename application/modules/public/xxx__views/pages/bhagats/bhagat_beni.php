<br/><h2>Bhagat Beni Ji </h2>
<hr/>
<p><strong>BENI, BHAGAT</strong> is one of the fifteen saints and sufis
    some of whose compositions have been incorporated in the Guru Granth S&atilde;hib.
    Very little is known about his personal life except that he spent most
    of his time in prayer and contemplation. Nabh&atilde;ji &#8216;s Bhagatm&atilde;l,
    which includes him in its roster of well-known bhaktas or devotees, narrates
    a popular anecdote about how Beni absorbed in meditation often neglected
    the household needs and how the Deity himself intervened and physically
    appeared to help him. Bh&atilde;i Gurd&atilde;s ( V&atilde;r&atilde;&ntilde;,
    X. 14) has referred to Beni&#8217;s single-pointed meditation in solitude
    en&shy;riched by moments of spiritual edification. </p>
<p> Beni&#8217;s three hymns in the Guru Granth Sahib are marked by an intense
    spiritual longing. They also indicate the various paths tried by him in
    his quest, his practical expe&shy;rience of life and his mastery of religious
    lore of diverse traditions. His five-stanza Iabda in Sri Raga, in terse
    and elliptical form, traces the gradual spiritual degeneration of man
    from the time of his birth to the end. It so closely resembles Guru N&atilde;nak&#8217;s
    Pahire hymns in the same r&atilde;ga that Guru Arjan, when compiling the
    Holy Book, recorded the instruction that Beni&#8217;s hymn be sung in
    the same tune as Pahire. In his hymn in R&atilde;ga R&atilde;mkali, Beni,
    using allegorical expressions of the yogis, dwells upon the gradual process
    leading to the highest spiritual knowledge which is also the ultimate
    bliss. This hymn, too, has close similarity with several of Guru N&atilde;nak&#8217;s
    verses in the same measure. It reveals Beni&#8217;s knowledge of the practices
    and terminology of hatha yoga as well as his rejection of them in favour
    of the cultivation of the Divine Name. In the hymn in R&atilde;ga Prabh&atilde;ti,
    Beni censures in the general tone of the Gurus&#8217; bani the hypocrisy
    of the Br&atilde;hman who practises outward piety while harbouring evil
    in the heart. He adds in conclusion that without the true Guru&#8217;s
    instruction way to liberation will not be found.</p>
