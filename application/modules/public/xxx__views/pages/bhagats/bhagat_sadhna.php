    one of the fifteen saints and s&uuml;fis whose hymns are incorporated
    in the Guru Granth S&acirc;hib, was a qas&atilde;i or butcher by profession
    who, by his piety and devotion, had gained spiritual eminence. He is believed
    to have been born at the village of Sehv&atilde;n, in Sindh. He was cremated
    at Sirhind, in the Punjab, where even today a tomb stands in his memory.
    He is considered to be a contemporary of N&atilde;m Dev, another medieval
    saint. Sadhna&atilde; lived by selling meat, though, as it is asserted,
    he never butchered the animals himself. His only sabda (hymn) in the measure
    Bil&atilde;val, in the Guru Granth S&atilde;hib, indicates his belief
    that all evil deeds of a man could be washed away by devoted meditation
    on the Name&#8212; and so the deeds of a butcher:&nbsp;What merit have you, Enlightener of the world, if our ill
    deeds
    are not effaced?&nbsp; <br/>
    What avails it to enter the asylum of the lion, if a mere jackal will
    be allowed to devour one?&nbsp;
<p> I am nothing, nor is anything mine Save my honour, O lord,! am your slave
    after all. (GG 858) the ammonite stone, symbolising god Vishnu of the
    Hindu Trinity. His spiritual quest led him to renounce the household.
    He left Sehv&atilde;n and roamed about the country preaching the love
    of God. None of his holy songs have survived except the solitary hymn
    preserved in the Guru Granth S&atilde;hib, which keeps his memory alive.
<p>He honours His Servants Himself, He Blesses with both hands on his forehead.According to the Holy Word, every kind of
    being can get liberated provided he or she moulds his or her life in keeping with the ideals of the true preceptors.
    There are evidences in the Sakhis (religious stories) about the Gurus that Kauda, a Kapalika with devilish
    tendencies got transformed through Guru Nanak's company into a noble being. Similarly, there was a robber who used
    to rob people wearing the garb of a noble. He gave up his evil deeds and devoted himself to remembering Divine Name
    and service of mankind. Then, there was prostitute by the name of Ganka who succeeded in achieving the ultimate end
    of her life by remembering the Name (Lord). Sadhna, the butcher, was also one such person who used to kill daily
    many innocent animals for earning his livelihood. He belonged to village Sihwan, in the Hyderabad region, known as
    the cradle of ancient civilization. The exact date and year of his birth are not known. On the basis of whatever
    little information we have about him, we can say that Sadhna was a contemporary of Bhagat Namdev.
<p>A hymn by Sadhna has been included in the Guru Granth Sahib; a fact which has immortalized him. It is said that
    Sadhna used Salgram (a stone idol symbolic of Siva) as a weight to weigh the meat he sold. One day an enlightened
    mendicant passed by, and he chided Sadhna for what he did. Sadhna repented and renounced his home and left for the
    forests. It is also said that on his way to the forests, a woman met him She felt so charmed by Sadhna that she
    wanted to possess him. However, Sadhna remained indifferent to all her actions. She thought that perhaps the
    presence of her husband is the hindrance and Sadhna does not take the initiative because of his fear. So the woman
    took no time in murdering her husband, thereby clearing the way for Sadhna. However, while committing this crime,
    she failed to read correctly the mental state of Sadhna who was then on the point of acquiring mystical unity with
    the Lord. Therefore, whatever she did, she failed to charm Sadhna. At last when she found defeat staring in her
    face, she alleged that Sadhna had killed her husband. Consequently, the poor Sadhna had his hands chopped off as a
    punishment for the crime he never committed. God has always protected his devotees and there are extant evidences to
    prove this contention : for example, He saved Prehlad, helped Namdev and saved the honour of Daropadi, similarly,
    Sadhna also prayed to God</p>
<p class="green">Nothing am I, no pride is mine; nothing is mine,<br/>
    On this occasion save the honour of Sadhna,<br/>
    the Servant. <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/858">SGGS-858</a></p>
<p>'The Lord listened to his prayer and accepted it. God through His graceful benevolence made his hands healthy once
    again. This gesture of grace by God flowed in Sadhna's mana (mind), the river of devotion to God.<br/>
    Pandit Tara Singh instead of referring to this incident narrates another story. He says that Sadhna was a Muslim
    butcher. It was under the influence of a holy-man that he turned a Hindu. The qazis took affront and decreed that he
    be bricked alive in a building wall. At that moment, Sadhna felt helpless and offered a prayer to the Lord saying: O
    Omniscient Lord! Come to my aid in time, lest I should lose my life.</p>
<p>It seems this anecdote has been invented by his followers to match explanation with his hymn because it is
    universally accepted that a true devotee of God is ever happy in His will The only hymn of Sadhna wherein he prays
    God to save his honour and which finds inclusion in the Guru Granth Sahib (P 858) would read asunder;</p>
<p class="blue">For love of a king's daughter<br/>
    a man disguised himself as Vishnu<br/>
    Of this man, lust-seeker, self-seeker, You saved the honour. (1)<br/>
    Enlightener of the world! what merit is yours if our<br/>
    retribution of deeds leave us not?<br/>
    Why seek shelter with the tiger if a jackal<br/>
    is to grip us? (1-Pause)<br/>
    The Chatrik (cuckoo) for lack of a drop suffers.<br/>
    If after its life is gone, even the ocean be found,<br/>
    what good? (2)<br/>
    Tired, without poise is my life-<br/>
    How may I delay supplicating Thee?<br/>
    If after drowning comes the boat,<br/>
    who will then ride it?<br/>
    Nothing am I, no pride is mine; nothing is mine.<br/>
    On this occasion save the honour of Sadhna,<br/>
    The servant. <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/858">SGGS-858</a></p>
<p>If we paraphrase the above hymn, it would read as follows; what is the use of seeking shelter with a lion if a jackal
    threatens life even then? If the chatrik (A type of bird) dies for want of a single drop of water, what is the use
    of a full ocean after that? If a boat becomes available after one drowns, it is of no use. He continues to pray to
    God with the help of such instances: In the world-ocean many waves of evil arise and the helpless life fails to save
    the boat of life. Therefore, the Omniscient and benevolent God is requested that He should come and save him rather
    soon. Sadhna says that there is none except Him whom he could call his own.</p>
<p>The whole Shabad conveys this message that the prayer made by a devotee in the court of his Lord should be saturated
    with devotion and submission otherwise it is just a formality which one observes and we all know fully well that
    unless the prayer is done from the core of heart with utmost devotion and dedication, it is not accepted in the
    court of Lord God.</p>
<p>According to Bhai Kahan Singh of Nabha, the mausoleum of Sadhna is near Sirhind which goes to suggest that Bhagat
    Sadhna travelling from Sindh reached Panjab during the fast days of his life. It was in Panjab that he breathed his
    last. As such, Sadhna got mingled in the soil of Panjab.</p>
