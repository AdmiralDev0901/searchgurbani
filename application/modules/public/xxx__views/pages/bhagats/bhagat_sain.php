<p><img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>/images/content/sain.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="249" align="left"/>SAIN,
    whose one hymn has been included in the Guru Granth Sãhib, is counted among the disciples of Rãmãnand (1300­1411).
    Guru Arjan, Nãnak V, says in one of his hymns in the Holy Book that the name of Sain was a household word as a
    bhakta of rare devotion (GG,487). In another, hymn, he refers to him as an example of dedication to the service of
    holymen. Bhakta Ravidàs in a sabda in the Guru Granth Sähib ranks Sain with Nãmdev, Kabir, Trilochan and Sadhnã in
    piety (GU. 1106). According to Bhãi Gurdäs, Sain was the disciple of Rãmänand and he had adopted him as his
    preceptor on hearing of the fame of Kabir (1398-1518) who, too, was Rãmãnand's disciple. All accounts agree that
    Sain was a barber, some stating that he served at the court of the king of Revã, then called Bändhavgarh, in Central
    India, while others hold that he was attached to the court of the ruler of Bidar in South India. Those supporting
    the South Indian tradition believe that Sain was a disciple of jnãnadeva. What is the best àrati or form of
    adoration of the Lord is the theme of Sain's pada incorporated in the Guru Granth Sãhib. According to Sain singing
    of His praise and meditating on His Name constitute the highest worship. These alone will ferry one across the
    fearful ocean and bring him liberation.
<p>There are two varying accounts of bhagat Sain's life. Some people hold that he was an employee of the ruler of Bidar
    and a faithful devotee of Saint Gyaneshwar. But according to the popular tradition he was a barber who served as a
    personal attendant under Raja Ram, the ruler of Bandhawgadh.</p>
<p>Bhai Gurdas, who regards him as a follower of Gosai Ramanand says that under Kabir's influence, Sain the barber
    became a bhagat. His nights were consecrated to a loving adoration of the Lord while the days were devoted to the
    humdrum duties at the King's darbar. Bhagat Sain as been classfied with the other greater bhagats in the Siri Guru
    Granth Sahib,</p>
<p class="blue"> With thy grace, O Lord I were redeemed<br/>
    Namdeva, Kabir and Trilochan<br/>
    As were Sadhna and Sain.<br/>
    Guru Arjan writes,<br/>
    Jaidev has abandoned ego,<br/>
    And, Sain, the barber, has been redeemed by serving the Lord.</p>
<p>Deeply interested in bhagati, Sain was always found in the company of the holy. Once a member of sadhus gathered
    together and went on reciting kirtan throughout the night, thus preventing Sain from attending to his work. Next
    morning when he went to the Raja and apologise for his absence from duty. The Raja remarked that he had done his job
    well.</p>
<p>Sain was overwhelmed with gratitude that God came to his rescue. The Raja realised that he had reached to such a
    elevated stage that God had sent someone else in place. Thus the Raja and his entire family became the devotees of
    Sain.<br/>
    Shabad by Bhagat Sain in the Siri Guru Granth Sahib<br/>
    Sri Sain:</p>
<p class="blue" align="center"> With incense, lamps and ghee,<br/>
    I offer this lamp-lit worship service.<br/>
    I am a sacrifice to the Lord. || 1 ||<br/>
    Hail to You, Lord, hail to You!<br/>
    Again and again, hail to You, Lord King, Ruler of all! || 1 || Pause ||<br/>
    Sublime is the lamp, and pure is the wick.<br/>
    You are immaculate and pure, O Brilliant Lord of Wealth! || 2 ||<br/>
    Raamaanand knows the devotional worship of the Lord.<br/>
    He says that the Lord is all-pervading, the embodiment of supreme joy. || 3 ||<br/>
    The Lord of the world, of wondrous form,<br/>
    has carried me across the terrifying world-ocean.<br/>
    Says Sain, remember the Lord,<br/>
    the embodiment of supreme joy!<br/>
    (SGGS)<br/>
    <br/>
    &quot;Lord Himself bestows honour on His devotees.&quot;</p>
<p>There is no denying the fact that the pure and pious souls influence mankind irrespective of the barriers of any
    kind. The kings make special efforts to get their history written but because of the precious deeds and altruistic
    words of the personages saturated in the love of God, new history is compiled daily in praise of them although it
    may not be possible to ascertain the exact date or year and place of their birth so as to confirm to the definition
    of history. Keeping their multi-faceted greatness in view, everybody feels proud in linking that personality to
    himself or considers himself blessed by linking himself with him. This has been the case with several contributors
    to the Sikh Scripture. Bhagat Sain is one such person. According to some scholars, Sain who was born in 1390 AD,
    belonged to Karnataka. Their assumption is based on the evidence that Sain was once in the service of the king of
    Bidar, a town in Karnataka. Some others opine that Sain remained for most of his life in the service of the King of
    Bandhavgarh in Rajasthan and thus conclude that he might have belonged to Rajasthan. Apart from these two schools of
    thought, there is another view which believes Sain to be a Panjabi. According to this view, Sain was born in the
    early morning of the full-moon day of Maghar in 1343 AD in the village of Sohal, in Amritsar district. His father's
    name was Baba Mukand Rai and mother's Jiwan. When he came of age, he went over to Lahore to stay with his aunt
    (father's sister). Sain married Sulakhani of Jalkhar, and led a householder's life. They had only one son born to
    them.</p>
<p>Later on, they migrated to Delhi from where he went into the service of a king of Rajasthan. It was during his stay
    there that he received spiritual enlightenment. Maybe, the above given facts are not unadulterated history, but this
    proves beyond doubt that the fame of Sain had reached beyond Panjab up to Rajasthan and Karnataka, but his links
    with Panjab are well established. Even now there stands a Gurdwara and a water reservoir in the village of Sohal
    Thathian to commemorate his memory. It is also said that Sain himself inaugurated the digging of this reservoir on
    the bank of which he used to spend long hours in meditation. Panjab Govt officially celebrated his 654th birthday on
    6.12.1997 in this village itself.</p>
<p>The biography of Sain as it emerges from the historically authentic evidences is narrated below:</p>
<p>In the only hymn of Sain that appears in the Guru Granth Sahib (P.695) under Dhanasri measure, he says with genuine
    pride that only his spiritual mentor Bhagat Ramanand knows the way to Naam-simran, (meditation of Name) and he
    perceives God as all-pervasive and immensely benevolent. Thus, it becomes obvious that Sain was disciple of Ramanand
    of Prayag who has been acknowledged the founder-preacher of the Bhakti movement in Northern India. Bhai Gurdas
    (Varan, X. 16) says that after Kabir, Sain was the second important disciple of Ramanand. Herein Bhai Gurdas gives
    ample information about him which can be summed up as follows:</p>
<p>After Kabir who enjoyed great name and fame, another person from the so-called low castes to rise to spiritual
    heights was Sain, a barber by birth, He used to remain absorbed in Divine Name at night and visit early morning to
    the royal palace to massage the king's body so as to cure it of various physical maladies. One day he had some
    guests and he remained occupied all the night in Kirtan or singing of Divine eulogy. Thus service of the saints and
    the Sangat made him miss his duty at the palace to serve the king. Realizing the intensity of his love for the
    saints and the Sangat, God Himself adopted Sain's form and went over to the palace and served the king.
    Consequently, the malady of the king was cured. On the other hand Sain, after he got free from his guests, went to
    the king with utter humility so as to seek forgiveness for his absence. The king saw from afar Sain approaching, an(
    calling him to his presence the king removed his cloak and put it on him as a token of his pleasure. He further told
    Sain that the way he massaged him last time had really captivated him. All his ailments have vanished. This was
    heard by the entire mankind. In this way God Himself intervened to prove the greatness of his devotee. Now let us
    see what Guru Arjan Dev has said in this connection in one of his hymns:</p>
<p class="green">His devotees, tasks has the Lord Himself<br/>
    undertaken to fulfil;<br/>
    These Himself has the Lord come to accomplish <a
        href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/783">SGGS-783</a></p>
<p>Referring to the incident related above, Bhai Gurdas says.</p>
<p class="green" align="center">Learning of the name earned by Kabir,<br/>
    Another Sikh, who came on the scene was Sain, the barber.<br/>
    He performed loving devotion at night and went to the king's court in the morn.<br/>
    Once many saint-guests came and Kirtan went on all the night.<br/>
    He could not leave his saint guests, and thus tailed to do duty at the king's.<br/>
    Lord Himself took Sain's form and entertained the king.<br/>
    After bidding farewell to all his guests, Sain reached the king with diffidence.<br/>
    The king called him from afar, and summoning near bestowed robes.<br/>
    You have captivated me, said the king and numberless people heard this.<br/>
    Lord Himself bestows honour on His devotees.</p>
<p>When the king heard from Sain's own lips the account of his absence, he thought very highly of the spiritual
    greatness of the saint. He was so impressed that he, along with his family, became disciples of Sain. Guru Arjan Dev
    has in a hymn reiterated such a view :</p>
<p>One that is lowly without a name,<br/>
    By contemplation of the Name in all<br/>
    four corners becomes revered.<br/>
    Beloved! Thy sight I seek: Pray grant it<br/>
    Numberless by Thy devotion are saved.<a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/386"> SGGS- 386</a></p>
<p>The above incident in Sain's life made his faith in God more intense and firm: it is inexpressible in words. From
    then onward Sain was always absorbed in the meditation of the Divine and sang songs in Praise of God who provides
    joys to all.</p>
<p>lt was perhaps keeping this episode in view that Ravidas has written about Sain and other saints like him. He said
    that God is capable of doing whatever he wishes.</p>
<p>Namdev, Kabir, Trilochan, Sadhna, Sain-all are saved.<br/>
    Saith Ravidas ; Listen ! devotees of God!<br/>
    All within the Lord's power lies. <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/1106">SGGS-1106</a></p>
<p>One more point becomes clear from the verse as quoted above: Ravidas was either a contemporary of Sain or was well
    familiar with his name and fame.</p>
<p>Guru Arjan Dev had composed a hymn in Basant measure wherein the Guru refers to Jaidev's egoity and then his
    discarding of it. Herein he also said that Sain had adopted the profession of a barber to earn his livelihood.
    Writing of his fame, the Guru says in a verse as follows:</p>
<p>Sain, the barber, was running errands,<br/>
    as known to all:<br/>
    The Lord in his heart taking abode,<br/>
    among the saints found he mention. <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/487">SGGS-487</a></p>
<p>This implies that Sain who did various odd jobs in the village had become very famous. The Guru felt it proper that a
    person's status should not be determined from one's profession or from the family in which he was born. Rather his
    deeds should determine his status in society. That is why he says about Namdev: God pushed the Brahmins and Khatris
    away, and instead embraced a calico printer as His son. Any profession is pious if it is marked by honesty and
    righteousness.</p>
<p>The hymn of Sain as included, in the Sikh Scripture is given below:</p>
<p class="green" align="center">Making devotion the incense, lamp and ghee for aarti,<br/>
    To the Lord am I a sacrifice.<br/>
    Sing you paeans of Divine joy:<br/>
    Sing ever paeans of glory of the Divine king. (Pause)<br/>
    Lord! realization that Thou art immaculate,<br/>
    Is for me the noble lamp and the holy wick.<br/>
    The way of Divine devotion is known to<br/>
    my master, Ramanand,<br/>
    Who expounds the Supreme Bliss,<br/>
    perfection incarnate.<br/>
    Lord of charming figure ! across the<br/>
    ocean of existence take me.<br/>
    Saith Sain : To the Master of Supreme Bliss<br/>
    be you devoted <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>guru-granth-sahib/ang/695">SGGS-695</a></p>
<p>This hymn could be summed up as follows : I am sacrifice unto them who are ever absorbed in the aarti of the supreme
    Lord (In fact the true aarti of God cannot be performed with the help of lamp and incense, rather it is possible
    only with one's firm faith and deep love for Him.) O God, it is only Thy devotees who recognize You, remember You,
    and sing Your praises. So please bless me with Thy grace so that 1 am also able to swim across this world-ocean.</p>
<p>Bhagat Sain spent his entire life in the name of God and ultimately breathed his fast in AD 1440 at the age of 50.
    His followers have been anxious even today to follow in his footsteps and thus make a success of their life by
    devoting themselves to singing eulogies of the Lord.</p>
<p class="blue">Saith Nanak God's devotees hunger to perform<br/>
    Divine laudation :<br/>
    The Name Eternal their prop.<br/>
    Day and night in Joy they abide;<br/>
    Of these bearing noble qualities<br/>
    dust of feet they make themselves. -Guru Nanak <a
