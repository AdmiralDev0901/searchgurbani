        SURDAS</strong>,
    one of the medieval Indian bhakta poets whose verses have been incorporated
    in the Guru Granth S&auml;hib. S&uuml;rd&atilde;s, whose original name
    was Madan Mohan, is said to have been born in 1529, in a high-ranking
    Br&atilde;hman family. As he grew up, he gained proficiency in the arts
    of music and poetry for which lie had a natural talent. He soon became
    a celebrated poet, singing with deep passion lyrics of Divine love. He
    attracted the attention of Emperor Akbar who appointed him governor of
    the parganah of Sandil&agrave;. But S&uuml;rd&atilde;s&#8217; heart lay
    elsewhere. He renounced the world and took to the company of holy men
    dedicating himself solely to the Lord. He died at Ban&atilde;ras. A shrine
    in the vicinity of the city honours his memory. <br/>
    The Guru Granth Sahib contains one hymn by Bhakta S&uuml;rd&auml;s, in
    the S&atilde;ra&ntilde;g measure. In fact, it is not a complete hymn but
    a single line: &#8220;0 mind, abandon the company of those who turn away
    from God.&#8221; It is believed to be the refrain of a complete hymn composed
    by S&uuml;rd&atilde;s in which he described one who had turned away from
    God as an incorrigible sinner for whom there was no hope of redemption.
    Guru Arjan omitted the rest of the hymn probably because it ran counter
    to the Sikh belief in God&#8217;s grace even for the worst of sinners.
    He therefore composed a hymn to explain and supplement the single line
    of S&uuml;rd&atilde;s. Its refrain is : &#8220;Men of God abide with the
    Lord.&#8221; <br/>
    Surd&agrave;s whose verse figures in the Guru Granth S&atilde;hib is to
    be differentiated from the blind poet of the same name who wrote S&uuml;r
    Sagar.<br/>
