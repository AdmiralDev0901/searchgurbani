<div class="content">
    <p>There
        are only two Swaiyas available, authored by Bhatt Haribans. Both these
        Swaiyas are written in praise of Guru Arjun Dev the 5th Guru. The importance
        of his Swaiyas lies in describing the time when Guru Ramdas left for his
        heavenly abode and Guru Arjun Dev ascended to the seat of pontification. </p>

    <p> He had the privilege of witnessing the celestial congregations of the
        4 11 and the 5th Gurus. According to him Guru Arjun Dev was bestowed the
        throne by the Akal Purkh, Himself and the canopy under which he sat was
        guarded by ange's and Heavenly bodies. A number of Brahmas and Vyasas
        marked their attendance in his divine court, they sat in the Sadh Sangat
        and were busy writing the Ved; Bhatt Haribans was a man of letters and
        had intimate knowledge of the myth a culture of India. He says </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><em><br/>
                It was the will of God, <br/>
                Guru Ramdas left for his Heavenly abode.<br/>
                &nbsp;He was received by Parmeshwar Himself <br/>
                And offered him the Seat of Honour, <br/>
                There were rejoicings in the heaven, </em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><br/>
        Praises of Guru Ramdas were sung by the celestial beings, The Demons ran
        away concealing the sins in their bosoms. Whosoever had a glimpse of Guru
        Ramdas got free of his sins. Guru Ramdas had passed on his throne and
        canopy to Guru Arjun the saviour of the universe. <br/>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Everlasting is the flow and unconquered are the waves of the Guru's
                Ganga, <br/>
                Where all the devotees bathe. <br/>
                The Puranas have sung his praises, <br/>
                And Brahma chants his glory, through Vedas <br/>
                There waves the royar whisk over his head, <br/>
                And he recites, ever the Nectar Name of God. <br/>
                The Lord, Himself is holding the holy canopy over him. <br/>
                Nanak, Angad, Amardas and Ramdas have submerged in the Eternal Light. <br/>
                Who says they are no more? <br/>
                Harivansh hails the glory of the Guru, Eternal and Everlasting. <br/>
                Their essence is imbued in the whole world. (1) </em><br/>

    <p> Haribans<b> </b>the ascetic, known
        for his <i>ta</i><i>pa</i><i>s, </i>i.e. renunciation and meditation,
        who accepted the Sikh faith at the hands of Guru Arjan, was head of the
        Sikh <i>dharamsälã </i>at Agra. According
        to Bhãi Mani Siñgh, <i>Sikhãñ di Bhaga</i><i>t</i><i> M</i><i>a</i><i>l</i><i>a</i><i>, </i>he served with
        devotion and
        humility the travellers who came to his <i>dharamsälã. </i>He would feed them,
        wash their feet with warm water, and massage their bodies to relieve them
        of fatigue. He would recite Gurbãni in the morning and the compositions
        of Bhãi Gurdãs in the afternoon.&nbsp; Some Sikhs objected to the latter
        practice saying that it was improper to recite compositions
        other than the hymns of the Gurus. Harbañs went to Guru Arjan to secure
        clarification. The Guru told him that compositions of Bhai Gurdãs were
        only an elaboration of the Gurbãni and could be recited with profit by
        the Sikhs. </p>
