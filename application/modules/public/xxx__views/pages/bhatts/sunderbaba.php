    <p>SUNDAR BABA , celebrated for his
        six-stanza composition, the Ramkali Sadu, incorporated in Guru Granth
        Sahib, was the great grandson of Guth Amar Dãs. His father, Anand Dãs
        son of Bäbä Mohri, was a man of a devout temperament. Sundar grew up in
        an environment of faith and piety and developed deep affection and reverence
        for Guru Amar Dãs, his great-grandfather. The theme of his poem, Sadu
        meaning call, is the ascension of Guru Amar Dãs, described in terms of
        his having been recalled by God Almighty. The hymn states how Guru Amar
        Dãs had completely surrendered himself to the Will .of the Supreme Being,
        ever remaining absorbed in meditation on the Name, how he had, through
        the favour of Gurus, attained the office of Guth, how he, at the time
        of his departure, had appointed Ram Dãs his successor and how he had
        told his family to abide by the Will of t.he Lord and not to weep,for
        him after
        him.</p>
