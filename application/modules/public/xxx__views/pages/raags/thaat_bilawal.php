                <p>Bilawal is the most basic of all the ten thaats. All the swars in the thaat are shuddha or all swars
                    in the natural scale. Bilawal as a raag is not rendered these days however a small variation of the
                    raag called Alahaiya Bilawal is very common. This is a mornig raag and its pictorial descriptions
                    create a rich, sensuous ambience in consonance with its performance.<br/>
