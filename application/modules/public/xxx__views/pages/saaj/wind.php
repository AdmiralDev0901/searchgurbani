                    <strong>1. Harmonium</strong><br/>
                    <strong></strong><img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>images/content/harmonium.jpg" alt="harmonium"
                                          width="165" height="91" align="left"/>The <em>harmonium </em>is popular kind
                    of <em>sushir vad. </em>The word <em>harmonium </em>is derived from the Greek word &ldquo;harmony&rdquo;
                    which is the basis of western music and implies simultaneous sounding of several notes or the
                    accompaniment of a melody by chords.<br/>
                    The <em>harmonium </em>has the appearance of a box out of which music can be produced. It is a
                    reed-blown instrument like a large harmonica with mechanical bellows and keyboard. It is said that
                    the <em>harmonium </em>was first produced in Paris in 1840 by Alexandre Debain. He devised a bellows
                    worked by the player&rsquo;s feet to force air into a wind-chest and then through channels opened or
                    closed by means of a keyboard. The notes are produced by reeds made of steel. The bellows is either
                    worked by feet or hand. When the keys are touched and bellows is inflated, the air passes through
                    the inner reeds and produces twelve notes (seven <em>shudh, </em>four <em>komal </em>and one <em>teevar). </em>The
                    <em>harmonium </em>has either single reed or double reeds. In case of double reeds, two notes of the
                    same type, in two <em>saptaks </em>are produced simultaneously. Generally, a <em>harmonium </em>has
                    three or three and a half <em>saptaks. </em>This instrument is very easy to handle and is very
                    popular in North India. The beginner can easily play it and learn both vocal and instrumental music.
                    The instrument has fixed notes and its tones cannot be changed. The <em>harmonium </em>can be used
                    also an<em> </em>accompaniment of a vocalist. Any <em>svara </em>(note) can take the place of S and
                    the raga played accordingly.<br/>
                    The twelve notes of the <em>harmonium </em>are not natural notes but are a tempered scale. In the
                    <em>saptak, </em>the difference between S and R and again between R and G and so on has been to
                    consistent and equal degree. The main defect of this instrument is that it has twelve artificial
                    notes though they correspond to the twelve natural notes (as for instance on a <em>sitar</em>). With
                    the accompaniment of <em>harmonium-</em>notes, the <em>svaras </em>of vocal music also tend to be
                    artificial.<br/>
                    By playing the <em>harmonium, </em>the human voice becomes artificial, because according to the
                    tradition of Indian classical music, the real notes of 22 <em>shruties </em>should be produced.
                    There are certain notes in classical music which cannot be reproduced by the <em>harmonium</em>, for
                    example _G_ in <em>raga tod,</em> M in<em> raga Lalit, </em>etc. Therefore, practice of
                    <em>svaras</em> on the <em>harmonium </em>tends to make the <em>svaras </em>unnatural or unreal.
                    Many classical singers frown at the use of <em>harmonium. </em>For Strange ways condemns the use of
                    the <em>harmonium </em>and regards it as a serious means of Indian music. He remarks &ldquo;Besides
                    its deadening effect on a living art., it falsifies it by being out of tune with its itself.&rdquo;
                    [2]<br/>
                    It is not good to practise <em>svara-sadhana </em>(note modulation) on the <em>harmonium. </em>It is
                    better to practise the <em>svaras </em>on the<em> tamboora</em>. When the strings are touched, they
                    vibrate and the note continues to sound for a while, but in the case of the <em>harmonium, </em>the
                    tone starts for a while, but in the case of the <em>harmonium, </em>the tone starts with inflation
                    of the bellows and when the bellows stop, the note comes to an end.<br/>
                    <em>Meend </em>(glide from one note to another) and<em> gamak </em>(delicately mixing
                    <em>svaras </em>in a <em>raga)</em> are not possible on a <em>harmonium </em>and as such, richness
                    and excellence of melody is unavailable. This instrument is not good for accompaniment of vocal
                    music, because it cannot reproduce the various delicate shades of vocal music. It is better to use a
                    <em>sarangi or bela </em>(a kind of violin) for the accompaniment of vocal music.<br/>

                    <strong></strong><img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>images/content/flute.jpg" alt="flute"
                                          width="165" height="44" align="left"/>This is very old and common wind
                    instrument found all over the world. It belongs to the category of <em>sushir vad </em>(wind
                    instrument)<br/>
                    In India, the flute is made of wood; however, some special flutes of ivory, brass and silver are
                    also used on special occasion. The <em>vedas </em>refer to the flute as <em>venu. </em>In North
                    India it is known by different names like <em>bansari, murali; </em>in South India it is called <em>pillam
                        kuzhal, pillam grovi, and kolalu. </em>The common flute is about a foot long and has a
                    mouthpiece and few holes. The length of the flute and the number of hole differ from one region to
                    another. The popular flute in South India is called <em>mukhaveena, </em>which is a double-reeded
                    pipe with seven holes. The bigger f lute-type instrument is called <em>nagaswara. </em>A new
                    instrument of the wind-family is the <em>shehnai. </em>The oboe-like double reed instrument is
                    supposed to be auspicious and is played to celebrate a marriage or festival. <em>Shehnai </em>concerts
                    have become popular these days. Bismillah Khan and his group of <em>shehnai-</em>players have own
                    the hearts of western audiences in Europe and America. It is possible to play
                    <em>alaap</em><em>, </em><em>tans, thumris, </em>and light tunes on the shehnai.</p></td>
