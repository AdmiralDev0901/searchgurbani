                    <br/>
                    Some of the stringed instruments are described below, along with instructions regarding how to tune
                    them.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <strong>1. Tanpura/Tamboora</strong><br/>
                    <strong></strong><img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>images/content/tanpura.jpg" alt="tanpura"
                                          width="55" height="150" align="right"/>This is one of the oldest and popular
                    instruments used for accompaniment of vocal music. Being a stringed instrument, it is remarkable
                    both for giving support to the notes of vocal music and as a drone.<br/>
                    There are four strings in the <em>tanpura. </em>The first to the left is of steel. Sometimes in a
                    <em>tanpura </em>is used for accompanying a male voice, the first string is of brass or bronze. This
                    string is called <em>oancham </em>because it gives out the note of P. This is tuned to the P of the
                    <em>madhya saptak </em>when accompanied by a harmonium. In the <em>raga</em> in which P is forbidden
                    (as for instance in <em>Malkaus raga), </em>this string is tuned to M <em>shudh. </em>In the first
                    place, the two middle strings of steel should be tuned to S of the male singer. The fourth string is
                    of brass or bronze. It is tuned to S of the <em>mandar saptak. </em>(In the case of a female voice
                    the S is set to fourth of fifth black reed of the <em>harmonium). </em>Some<em> tanpuras</em>have
                    five to six strings. The normal tuning is P S S S. If there is no P in a raga, then tune M S S S. In
                    case of the fifth string, the tuning will be as such: If there is N in the raga, then P N S S S : if
                    there is no N in the raga, then P S S S S: if there is no P in raga then M S S S S. In case of a 6th
                    string, the tuning will be as follows: If there is NI in a raga, then P N S S S S: if there is no N
                    in a raga, then P S S S S S; if there is P in a raga, then M S S S S S.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <strong>2. Sitar</strong><br/>
                    <strong></strong><em>S<img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>images/content/sitar.jpg" alt="sitar"
                                               width="90" height="150" align="left"/>itar </em>literally is a form of
                    the Persian word-<em>sihtar-</em>which means three strings. In the beginning, there were only three
                    strings, but now seven strings are used.<br/>
                    The components of a <em>sitar </em>are similar to those of the <em>tanpura. </em>It has a <em>toomba,
                        tabli, keel, dhurch, dand, gulu, atti gahan </em>and <em>sirra</em> like the <em>tanpura. </em>It
                    has however seven <em>khootiyan </em>(pegs) and one<em> manka </em>(bead).<br/>
                    The <em>sitar</em>has seven strings. The first string on the left is made of steel. It is called
                    <em>Baj-ki-tar. </em>It is tuned to M of <em>mandar saptak. </em>This is the string which is more
                    frequently used in playing the <em>sitar.</em><br/>
                    <em></em>The second string is made of bronze and is called <em>jori-ka-tar. </em>The string is tuned
                    to S of <em>mandar saptak. </em>The third string is made of bronze. This is also
                    <em>jori-ka-tar. </em>The string is also tuned to S of <em>mandar saptak </em>like the second
                    string. These two strings are tuned in the very beginning like the <em>tanpura. </em>The fourth
                    string is made of steel. This is tuned to P of <em>mandar saptak. </em>The sixth string is made of
                    thin steel and it s called <em>chikari. </em>It is tuned to S of <em>mandar saptak. </em>The seventh
                    string is also made of thin steel and is also called <em>chikare. </em>It is tuned to S of <em>Tar
                        saptak. </em>Some people tune the seventh string to the <em>pancham </em>(P) of <em>madhya
                        saptak.</em><br/>
                    <br/>
                    <strong>3. Mikrab</strong><br/>
                    <strong></strong>This is the plectrum made of steel or brass which is worn on the right hand index
                    finger. When the plectrum plays on the strings, it produces vibrations which causes different notes.
                    When the plectrum touches the first string, the sound produced is of D and on the second is that of
                    R. Some sitars have ab extra <em>toomba </em>(gourd) at the end of the neck or midway. The sitar is
                    played with the following <em>gat </em>(sequences):<br/>
                    <br/>
                    (a) <em>Alaap: </em>It corresponds to the vocal style of the raga.<br/>
                    (b) <em>Jor:</em> This is the playing of the raga on the sitar in medium tempo after the
                    <em>alaap </em>and without <em>tal.</em><br/>
                    <em></em>(c)<em> Jhala: </em>Playing on the <em>chikari </em>strings in quick tempo which like D R R
                    R - is called <em>jhala. </em>The first string gives the note of D, and the final <em>chikari </em>give
                    the tone of R.<br/>
                    (d) <em>Asthai and Antra: Asthai </em>is fixed composition of the raga. The <em>antra </em>is the
                    compliment to the<em> asthai. </em>In the improvisation of the raga, after <em>asthai</em> and<em>
                        antra, meend </em>(gliding) <em>and jamjam/murki </em>(trill) are played frequently.
                    <em>Tans </em>are also played.<br/>
                    Nowadays <em>sitarists </em>generally play in <em>khayal </em>style. Sometimes <em>thumri </em>style
                    is also used. Like <em>khayal </em>singers, instrumentalists will play in <em>drut laya </em>(fast
                    tempo). They will play a new <em>asthai </em>and <em>antra, </em>generally in <em>teental </em>and
                    then improvise at a very fast tempo until the performance reaches an exciting climax. This section
                    is called <em>drut gat </em>(fast composition) and is climaxed by a fast <em>jhala </em>piece.<br/>
                    The sitar is very delicate instrument and as such it is to be kept and maintained with care and
                    caution. The following points need to be noted:<br/>
                    (a) The sitar should be kept covered, preferably in a cloth cover or a plastic bag.<br/>
                    (b) The sitar should be kept lying on the floor, the frets facing upwards. It can also be kept
                    standing in a corner.<br/>
                    (c) The sitar should be cleaned frequently with a piece of soft cloth.<br/>
                    (d) The strings should be periodically loosened so as to reduce the tension on them.

                    <strong>4. Venna</strong><br/>
                    <img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>images/content/veena.gif" alt="veena" width="45" height="150"
                         align="right"/>Perhaps the oldest stringed instrument belonging to the seventh century is
                    the<em> veena. </em>There are various kinds of <em>veena,</em> but mainly they belong to two
                    categories: north Indian and south Indian. The north Indian <em>veena is </em>called <em>vachitra
                        veena </em>and has no frets. The south Indian <em>veena </em>is more complicated and is called
                    <em>saraswati veena. </em>As the name implies, this instrument is supposed to be the favourite of
                    Saraswati, the goddess of learning. Some of the <em>veenas </em>have the painting of the goddess on
                    the body. There are also other types of <em>veenas </em>with motifs of peacocks or crocodiles or
                    some animal. The <em>veena </em>has seven strings of brass. Four strings are tuned to S, P, S, P and
                    the remaining three are drone strings tuned to S P S. The south Indian <em>veena </em>has
                    twenty-four frets fixed by wax. It may have one or two resonating gourds. It can be played with
                    fingers or with a plectrum. There is also a superior kind of <em>veena </em>carved out of one piece
                    of wood. The <em>veena </em>is played in a horizontal position as it rests on the lap of the player.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <strong>5. Sarangi</strong><br/>
                    <strong></strong><img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>images/content/sarangi.jpg" alt="sarangi"
                                          width="90" height="150" align="left"/>The <em>sarangi</em> is a popular
                    stringed instrument of North India. It has been in use from the thirteenth century. It can be played
                    either solo or as an accompaniment of <em>khayal or thumri </em>or folk-song. The body is of teak
                    wood and the lower part is covered with skin. The upper part containing the pegs is jointed to the
                    lower part. Generally, there are three strings made of cat-gut and re tuned to S, P, S in <em>mandar
                        saptak. </em>In some cases, first string may be of metal. Some <em>sarangis </em>also have few
                    sympathetic strings under the main three strings. It is held in a vertical position and played with
                    a bow which is different from that used for a violin.<br/>

                <p><strong>6. Rabab</strong><br/>
                    <strong></strong>This stringed instrument was used in Punjab, but Guru Nanak used it s an
                    accompaniment for <em>Gurumat Sangeet </em>(Sikh sacred music). It was played by his disciple named
                    Bhai Mardana (1459-1519) who originally was a<em> mirasi </em>(Muslim musician). It is similar to
                    the rebec of Persia. The <em>rabab</em> has a piece of hollow wood at the top and a hollow circular
                    wooden belly covered with a sheep skin at the bottom. There are two bridges, one in the middle and
                    the other at the tip. The two bridges support six gut strings which are manipulated by six pegs at
                    the top. Some <em>rababs </em>have a wooden <em>toomba </em>(gourd) at the top. It is played with a
                    traingular wooden plectrum. Its sound resembles the human voice and it can play some gamaks. The
                    effect of the drum-sound produced by it is very pleasing; it is eminently suitable for devotional
                    music.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <strong>7. Sarinda/Surinda</strong><br/>
                    <strong></strong>This instrument closely resembles the <em>sarangi</em>. It is about two feet long,
                    and its bottom is oval. The upper part is left open and a small part of body is covered with a
                    parchment. It has three cat-gut strings which produce notes of S, M, P. The upper ends of the
                    strings are tied up to the pegs and lower ends to the hook below. It was used by the Sikh Gurus and
                    their bards. It is played with a bow. Sometimes small bells (<em>gungroos) </em>are attached to the
                    bow to produce rhythmic jingle along the notes.</p></td>
