                                 height="100" align="right"/></strong>Tabla falls under the category of <em>avanad
                        vad </em>(percussion instruments). It is an ancient indigenous <em>tal vad.</em><br/>
                    <em></em>It consists of two drums standing upright. Bharata mentions the procedure of applying the
                    paste on the drum. However it became popular during the Moghul rule because it was, and even today
                    is regarded as a fit accompaniments for <em>khayal </em>and <em>thumri </em>compositions.<br/>
                    The drum with the black paste called <em>siyahi, </em>played by the right hand, is the real <em><a
                            href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>saaj/tabla">tabla</a>, </em>because its tone-range is roughly
                    and octave. The drum played with the left and is the bass or the drone counterpart and is called
                    <em>dugga </em>or<em> duggi </em>or<em> bayan.</em> Tabla requires a lot of practice for reproducing
                    different tals, especially half hatras. According to Danielou, &ldquo;The drummer of our Indian
                    village is in no way technically inferior to the most celebrated concert musicians.&rdquo;[3] Allah
                    Rakha and Samta Prasad are two well-known tabla players who have delighted both Indian and Western
                    audiences.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    TUNNING THE<a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>saaj/tabla"> TABLA</a><br/>
                    A <em>Tabla-</em>player keeps the two drums in front of him, the real <em>tabla </em>on his right
                    and the <em>duggi </em>on his left. The right drum is tuned to S or P. In the <em>raga </em>in which
                    P is omitted, it is tuned to M. A small hammer is used for tuning, the cylindrical wood-pieces under
                    the straps. If the tabla is to be tuned down, the <em>gitki </em>(wood-piece) is pushed up. After
                    hammering on one <em>gitki, </em>the next one to be set is on the opposite side. In this manner, all
                    the <em>gitkies </em>are hammered and while hammering them, the <em>tabla </em>is struck with the
                    hand to find out if the <em>svara </em>of the<em> tabla </em>matches with the base note of the
                    instrument which the musician is using. After the <em>gitkies </em>are set up, the <em>gajra </em>(top-skin)
                    is adjusted in case there is still some minor tone variation. The <em>duggi</em> or the left <em>tabala </em>is
                    adjusted with the <em>gajra. </em>In some sets of <em>tabala, </em>the <em>duggi </em>has also
                    some<em> gitkies</em> which are adjusted in the same manner as those of the right drum. In case
                    there is no black paste (<em>siyahi) </em>on the <em>duggi</em>, it should be covered with <em>atta
                        (</em>wheat-dough). The dough should be removed or gently scratched after use. The right <em>tabla </em>can
                    prodice a variety of complicated rhythms, while the<em> duggi</em> can produce a variety of
                    complicated rhythms, while the <em>duggi</em> can only produce the main outline of the particular
                    <em>tal (</em>rhythm). An expert tabla player (tablachi) can even play half <em>matras </em>skillfully.<br/>

                    <strong>2. Mridanga/Pakhawaj</strong><br/>
                    <strong></strong><img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>images/content/mridangam.jpg" alt="mridangam"
                                          width="151" height="101" align="left"/>The mridanga is an ancient instrument
                    of <em>avanad vad </em>and is also called <em>tal vad. </em>It is said that Lord Shiva used to do
                    <em>Tandava Nirtya-</em>cosmic dance with the help of this instrument. Bharata calls it <em>pushkar
                        vad. </em>This word was adapted as <em>Pakhawaj. </em>As such, <em>mridanga and pakhawaj </em>are
                    practically the same.<br/>
                    <em>Pakhawaj </em>was, and even today is, popular as an accompaniment of <em>dhrupad </em>and <em>dhamar. </em>The
                    <em>mridanga </em>was formerly a clay-drum but now it is made of wood. The structure of the <em>pakhawaj </em>resembles
                    that of the <em>tabla</em>, the main difference being that the tabla consists of two drums, while
                    the <em>pakhawaj </em>is one long barrel-like drum with skin-covers on both unequal sides. The left
                    side is smaller than the right side. The <em>pakhawaj </em>is tuned like the<em> tabla. </em>There
                    are two ways of playing the <em>mridanga. </em>It can play twenty-five<em> varanas, </em>both
                    primary and secondary as follows:<br/>
                    Primary <em>varnas: </em>Ta, Ta, Di, Thu, Na, Dha, Dda, Draday, <br/>
                    Thee, Ga, Rivrar, Jhem.<br/>
                    Secondary <em>varnas: </em>Ran, Ka, Ga, Rran, Dhou, Dhi, Lan,<br/>
                    Thace, Dan, Dhi, Ki, Ti, Thrar.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <strong>3. Dholak</strong><br/>
                    <strong></strong><img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>images/content/dholak.jpg" alt="dholak"
                                          width="83" height="150" align="right"/>The other popular drum instrument is
                    called <em>dholak</em> or <em>dhavul. </em>It is like the<em> mridanga, </em>but its two sides are
                    equal in size. It is about two feet long and one foot in diameter. It can be played with hands or
                    with sticks. It is used for hymn-singing, folk music and folk-dance. The left side is like bass and
                    other side can be tuned to a high pitch by tightening the cotton-rope braces. The other drum-type
                    instrument are <em>nagara, tasha, kajira, and damru.</em><br/>

                <p><strong>4. Dhadh</strong><br/>
                    <strong></strong><img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>images/content/damru.jpg" alt="damru"
                                          width="151" height="115" align="left"/>It is small two-sided wooden drum. Some
                    call it the <em>damru. </em>It is about 10 to 12 inches in length with a narrow waist in the middle.
                    The parchments are held by cotton straps. It is held in the left hand and played with the right
                    hand.</p></td>
