    Hand written script of Sri Dasam Granth Sahib Ji, at Syracuse, New York, U.S.A</p>
<p>The Dasam Granth consists of 1428 pages. According to all available evidence, it was compiled by Bhai Mani Singh, the
    devout and learned Sikh custodian of the Golden Temple (who later became a martyr) 26 years after the death of Guru
    Gobind Singh, at Damdama. But, some historians assert that it was not the adi Granth, but his own Book that the Guru
    dictated to Bhai Mani Singh. However, much of its secular portion is the subject of great controversy even amongst
    the Sikhs who ascribe its authorship not to the Guru but to some of his 52 poets who lived at his court.</p>
<p>The Contents of this Granth, which is mostly in Braj Bhasha, are (1) Jap, or meditations. (2) Akal Ustati, or the
    praises of God and the denunciation of ritual, superstition and cant, (3) Chandi Charitra, I and II, or the life of
    Chandi, the goddess of war, (in Braj) (4) Var, or ballad of Durga, the exploits of the goddess of war (in Punjabi),
    (5) Gyan Prabodh, or the sayings of Wisdom, which also include some tales from Mahabharta, (6) Chaubis Avtar, or the
    life-stories of the incarnations of Vishnu, according to the Hindus, and Brahrnavatar and Rudravtdr, (7) Shabd
    Hazare, or devotional hymns, (8) Thirty-three Swayyas, or the praises of the one immortal, unknowable God of wonder
    and grace, (9) Khalsa Mahima. or words in praise of the Khalsa, (10) Shastra Nam-Mala; verses in praise of many
    arms, (11) Charitro pkhyan or 404 tales of the wiles of women, (12) Zafar Namah (in Persian), or letter of victory,
    addressed to Aurangzeb, (13) Hikayats, or legends and tales, also in Persian, including some stories on the lines of
    Charitro pakhyan.</p>
<p>As soon as the Dasam Granth was compiled, it led to a great controversy among the Sikh divines, especially in
    relation to its secular portions and more notably in regard to the Charitro-pakhyan and Hikayats. It was decided to
    divide the book. Bhai Mehtab Singh of Mirankot (who was charged by the Panth to capture or assassinate Massa Ranghar
    who had then planted himself in the holy Golden Temple at Amritsar and was desecrating its sanctity) suggested to
    the leaders of his community that if he came back victorious in his mission, the book should be preserved in one
    volume, otherwise it may divided into two. Mehtab Singh was successful in putting Massa Ranghar to an ignoble death
    and hence the volume was preserved as it now is. This, however, as the Sikh savant, Bhai Kahan Singh points out,
    (See Gurmat Sudhakar, second edition, P.35) is a most arbitrary way of settling a point of such literary and
    theological significance. Moreover, a single man's point of view should not have prevailed, -especially of a
    military hero, or even a Jathedar in search of martyrdom, in preference to the viewpoint of the theologians and
    scholars who were still discussing the point. Several recensions of this volume are now current, some of which
    contain some extra hymns also. Though it is a pity that the text of the Dasam Granth has yet to be fixed by scholars
    and theologians, it is our considered opinion that the secular portion of what is now available in print is also the
    creation of the Guru himself, not only because of the internal evidence of style and diction, but also because the
    secular portion, including Charitro-pakhyan does not, by any chance, contradict the Guru's philosophy of a
    full-blooded, though detached life in all its manifestations. A supreme artist that the Guru was, he could not
    ignore to write about the seamy side of life, though he does not commend it anywhere.</p>
<p>To pick up on the Guru's extensive use of Hindu mythology, or the praises of Krishna's scintillating play on the
    flute, or the most sensitive portrayal of feminine beauty and charm, the inclusion of certain erotic scenes, or how,
    in the days of Ramayana, the Kashatryas worshipped the Brahmins, of the call of the heroes in some of the Hikiyats
    to bring them a cup of intoxicating wine, etc , and to disso-ciate the Guru from their authorship would be the
    height of artistic sacrilege. The Guru who, in his Akal Ustat (whose authorship anyhow is beyond doubt) can write
    this about God : &quot;Now you are a beggar, now a King; now the reciter of the Gayatri, now the Muezzin giving
    &quot;all to prayer; now the lover of own wife, now the lover of another woman; now you are the strong drink, now
    the drunkard,&quot; (6:16) could not but be a man of superbly catholic mind, seeing the variegated mani-festation of
    God in everything and everywhere. And was it not Guru Nanak who said '0 God, wondrous are those who tread Thy path
    and wondrous are those who are strayed away.&quot; (Var Assa). <strong>It is very difficult however, for puny,
        hide-bound minds to appreciate this grandeur of spiritual and aesthetic vision.</strong></p>

<p>At present there is considerable controversy surrounding the authorship of parts of the collection of the writings of
    Guru Gobind Singh, the <em>Dasam Granth</em>. The history of this scripture is as follows:</p>
<p>The collected writings of Guru Gobind Singh are known as <em>Dasam Granth</em> (&quot;Scripture of the Tenth Guru&quot;).
    The writings of the poets in his court comprise a different scripture, known as <em>Vidiya Sar</em> (&quot;Pool of
    Knowledge&quot;). According to a famous history of the Sikhs written in 1843, <em>Suraj Prakash</em> (&quot;Rising
    of the Sun&quot;), 52 scholar-poets and 7 pandits always lived in the court of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. The writings of
    the poets were written on paper in fine script, and according to Suraj Prakash, the weight of this Vidiya Sar was
    &quot;9 maunds.&quot;</p>
<p>On the night of 5 December 1705 AD, Guru Gobind Singh left his court in Anandpur, after a long siege by Hindu and
    Muslim armies. During this departure, the Guru's possessions, including both the Dasam Granth and Vidiya Sar, were
    carried away by the strong current of the flooding Sarsa stream. However, in those days it was customary to make
    copies of Guru Gobind Singh's writings and the writings of the poets. In addition to the 52 poets and 7 pandits, 39
    scribes had lived in Guru Gobind Singh's court. Because of the faith of his devotees, copies of Guru Gobind Singh's
    writings always exceeded those of the poets, and these copies were kept safely with many devotees.</p>
<p>After Guru Gobind Singh left his mortal body in 1708, religious-minded people began trying to take care of his
    writings. First of all, Bhai Mani Singh Shahid (martyr), who was at that time Head Priest at Amritsar and also a
    great scholar, with great efforts collected the writings of Guru Gobind Singh and compiled one copy thereof.</p>
<p>Bhai Kesar Singh Chhibbar&ndash;whose family had been diwans (administrators) of the Gurus, including his
    great-grandfather who was diwan of the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Gurus, whose grandfather and father were diwans of
    Guru Gobind Singh, and who himself attended Mata Sundri Ji (wife of Guru Gobind Singh)&ndash;has written in his 1769
    book known as <em>Bansavalinama Dasan Patshahian Ka </em>(&quot;Lineage of the Ten Kings&quot;), &quot;This book
    which contained the life stories of avtars was compiled by Bhai Mani Singh. He provided travel expenses for various
    people. One Sikh brought a large amount of cash. That cash was used by Bhai Mani Singh to make payments to the Sikhs
    for expenses in searching for the writings of Guru Gobind Singh.&quot;</p>
<p>Only Mata Sundri, Bhai Mani Singh Shahid, and Bhai Shisha Singh (who stayed with Mata Sundri in Delhi and was
    compiling the Dasam Granth) can know about the authenticity of Dasam Granth. Later, Baba Deep Singh Shahid, Bhai
    Sukha Singh, and many other religious workers collected the writings of Guru Gobind Singh and edited the Dasam
    Granth. Among those birs (copies) of Dasam Granth, those written by Bhai Mani Singh Shahid, the one in the library
    of Sangrur, and the one in Moti Bagh Gurdwara, Patiala, are at present kept safely. The Dasam Granth preserved at
    Patna Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Gobind Singh, is also famous. But in these Dasam Granth birs, the banis (sacred
    writings) are not written in the same order, nor is their number equal. The reason is that as and when the devotees
    found copies of the writings, they included them in their collections. Those who had greater means for making these
    collections were certainly more successful in collecting more banis. But from those birs, many banis are the same
    and appear to be written from the same one source. It was due to the unavailability of proper means of collection
    that there were differences in the size and shape of the birs. At first people called the collection <em>Bachittar
        Natak. </em>Later is was known as <em>Dasmen Patshah da Granth</em>. But now the Holy Book is called <em>Dasam
        Granth.</em></p>
