            <td><p>The playing of one avartan of a tal on the table (pair of drums ) is called theka. It includes the
                    repetition of sound syllabes (bol) to form rhythmic phrases. There are different types thekas, for
                    example jhaptal and sooltal have both ten matras but their thekas differ. In jhaptal, there are
                    three hand claps and one blank, in sooltal there three claps and two blank, thus making ten as
                    mentioned in the following Table:</p>
                <p>Jhaptal</p>

                    Words DHI NA DHI DHI NA TI NA DHI DHI NA<br/>

                <p>Sooltal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br/>
                    Words DHI DHA DIN TA KIT DHA TIT KAT GAT GIN<br/>
                    Theka + 0 2 3 0</p>
                <p>The word &quot;theka&quot; literally means &quot;support&quot; (Pathak 1976). Originally the theka
                    was nothing more than a &quot;groove&quot; that is laid down for the accompaniment of other
                    musicians. However in the last few centuries it has emerged as &quot;the&quot; signature for any
                    north Indian tal.</p>
                <p>Theka is generally conceived of as a conventionally accepted arrangement of common bols. Such bols as
                    Dha, Dhin, Ta, Na, and Tin are the most common. The majority of common thekas may be played using
                    only these bols.</p>
                <p>A very common example is tintal</p>
                <p>XDha Dhin Dhin Dha 2Dha Dhin Dhin Dha 0Dha Tin Tin Na 3Na Dhin Dhin Dha </p>
                <p>The topic of the theka and its bols is complicated by the pakhawaj. There are many thekas which are
                    derived from this instrument. These tend to use very different bols. It is very common to see
                    phrases such as Dha Dha Din Ta, or Te Te Ka Ta Ga Di Ge Na. One very common theka from the pakhawaj
                    is Chautal; it goes like this:</p>
                <p>XDha Dha Din Ta 2KiTa Dha Din Ta 3TeTe KaTa 4GaDi GeNa </p>
                <p>We may make a few observations about the structure of theka. There is a tendency for theka to be
                    based upo </p>
                <p>XDhin Na 2Dhin Dhin Na 0Tin Na 3Dhin Dhin Na </p>
                <p>In this example the structure Dhin Na Dhin Dhin Na is opposed by Tin Na Dhin Dhin Na</p>
                <p>This symmetry is also illustrated in dadra tal; it goes like this:</p>
                <p>XDha Dhin Na 0Dha Tin Na </p>
                <p>In this last example the phrase Dha Dhin Na is reflected in the structure Dha Tin Na.</p>
                <p>It must be stressed that there are numerous thekas which do not exhibit this symmetrical quality.
                    Therefore symmetry must be considered a tendency rather than a rule. Rupak is a very common theka
                    which is asymmetrical; it goes like this:</p>
                <p>0Tin Tin Na 1Dhin Na 2Dhin Na </p>
                <p>There is another observation that we can make about the structure of the theka; there is a tendency
                    for the bols to follow the structure of the vibhag. If we look back at the jhaptal in the earlier
                    example we see that the 2,3,2,3, clapping arrangement of jhaptal is reflected in the bols Dhin Na
                    Dhin Dhin Na Tin Na Dhin Dhin Na. Again, the numerous exceptions show that this is merely a tendency
                    rather than a rule.</p>
                <p>Closly allied with the concept of theka is the prakar. The term prakar indicates that there is not
                    just one way to play the theka but there are numerous variatons. Some of these variations are a
                    technical necessity and others are artistic.</p>
